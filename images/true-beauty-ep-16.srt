(Final Episode)

2
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:18,780
You didn't have to walk me home.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,620
It's because we're a guy and a girl today.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,690
I wouldn't if we were friends.

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,631
You live too close to the station.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,500
What do you mean? It's so far.

7
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,771
No, it isn't. It's super close.

8
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,670
We're here.

9
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,540
Get home safely.

10
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:43,311
Ju Kyung.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,740
Yes?

12
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,951
I'm...

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,951
using my wish.

(Prince Comics)

15
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,571
Seo Jun, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,481
We still have a few dates left.

17
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,380
You should head inside.

18
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,521
Do you still like Ju Kyung?

19
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,790
Did you ask her out?

20
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,061
No. We're going out.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,171
I know you're lying.

22
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,600
What do you know?

23
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,540
I told you I met her yesterday.

24
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,611
Why did it have to be yesterday?

25
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,380
- Because of the first snow. - What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,051
You guys aren't going out, are you?

27
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,220
You must be a little nervous.

28
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,730
- No. - You little punk.

29
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,771
I can't believe they hugged each other.

30
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,211
But we broke up.

31
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,811
I haven't missed you at all.

32
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:46,851
Hey, you're up.

33
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,950
Yes.

34
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,890
Who gave you these flowers?

35
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,260
Do you have a boyfriend?

36
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,991
No.

37
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:56,661
I saw it in your room, and I brought it out.

38
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:58,130
I didn't want it to wither.

39
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,601
I totally forgot about it.

40
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,340
Flowers are pretty when they're in a vase.

41
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,380
But I feel bad for them when they wither without receiving any love.

42
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,861
Are you busy?

43
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
I'm at your agency.

44
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,830
Can we meet after you finish practicing?

45
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,200
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

46
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,111
(I'll wait for you in the lobby.)

47
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,791
Seo Jun.

48
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,731
Why didn't you leave after seeing me not reply?

49
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,400
You've been waiting here for hours.

50
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,760
Well...

51
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,830
- You see... - Yes, I see you. What is it?

52
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,971
Did you eat?

53
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
Should we go eat?

54
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,340
Are you asking me out on a date?

55
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,241
I'm busy today.

56
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,911
I need to tell you something.

57
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,150
You can save that for next time.

58
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,210
I'm too busy today...

59
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,820
to go on a date.

60
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,580
Let's just settle with this.

61
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,671
Seo Jun.

62
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,111
By the way, did you hear?

63
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:53,710
Soo Ho's going back to the States tonight.

64
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,950
- What? - He apparently came here...

65
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,250
to take care of things after his dad got better.

66
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,291
You'd better get going if you want to catch him before he leaves.

67
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,890
Why are you just standing there?

68
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:09,291
You should get going. You don't want to miss him.

69
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,601
Go. Get going already.

70
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:16,171
Go on.

71
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,000
See you.

72
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,801
The doors are closing.

73
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,840
What's this?

74
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,210
Why are you suddenly studying so hard?

75
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,241
Blow out the candle. I'm not going to sing a song.

76
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,850
Happy birthday to you

77
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,661
Happy birthday to you

78
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,120
I thought you weren't going to sing.

79
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,460
Ju Kyung.

80
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,061
Yes?

81
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,070
Which number are you going to pick for the questions you don't know?

82
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,301
Let's see. Number three?

83
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,700
Then I should pick everything else but that one.

84
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,811
Wait.

85
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,911
Here.

86
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,641
Don't get too nervous and good luck.

87
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,281
Thanks.

88
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,090
Here. Good luck to you too.

89
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:17,891

1, 2, 3.

93
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,200
- You guys. - Why do you all look so awkward?

94
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,240
You guys look too sad.

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,570
- Look more natural. - Okay, fine.

96
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,340
- Let's be cute. - Ready?

97
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,240
- 1, 2, 3. - Goodbye, Saebom High School!

98

- Okay. - Ju Kyung.

99
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,911
Aren't you going to take a photo with me?

100
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,151
My gosh, Seo Jun.

101
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,751
Why are you interrupting?

102
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,251
Okay, Seo Jun.

103
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,421
We'll take a photo of you together. Stand right here.

104
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,350
- Go on. - Stand there.

105
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,521
- My gosh. - Nice shot.

106
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,661
- Get ready. - Stand close to each other.

107
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:55,431
- Stand close. - 1, 2, 3.

109

- Let's try one more time. - Hey, let's take a proper photo.

Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,251
Are you gone already?

119
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:28,950
You jerk.

120
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,490
Why did you come back if you were going to leave?

121
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,791
Why did you follow me around?

122
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,360
My gosh.

124
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,370
Don't go.

125
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:59,551
Please don't go.

126
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,251
I won't let you go.

127
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,921
So please don't leave.

128
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:09,090
I'm not going anywhere.

129
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,261
Don't you dare.

130
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,570
So don't cry.

131
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,251
- Don't go. - I won't.

132
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,891
I didn't show it,

133
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,460
but I was insanely nervous.

134
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,690
- About what? - That you'd refuse...

135
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,901
to see me.

136
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:46,960
Liar.

137
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,470
It's true.

138
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,171
You were planning to leave today.

139
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,501
What do you mean?

140
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,271
I heard you were going back to the US tonight.

141
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,811
Why would I?

142
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,480
What's with your luggage?

143
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,551
I was unpacking.

144
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,751
What do you mean? Seo Jun said you were going back...

145
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:08,791
He said that?

146
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,891
Well...

147
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,161
Did you run over here thinking I was leaving?

148
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,401
- No, that's not it. - To stop me?

149
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,931
That's not it.

150
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,901
Ju Kyung. Ju Kyung!

151
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,740
- Why are you running away? - I am not.

152
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,980
Didn't you come to see me?

153
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:37,710
I have to go home. It's very important.

154
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,751
That's not the way.

155
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:44,791
I'll take you home.

156
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,330
Do you hate me?

157
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:54,631
Won't you let me see your face?

158
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,700
You were coming back anyway.

159
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,100
You came back anyway.

160
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,440
So why did you do that?

161
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:06,110
Because it would be...

162
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,881
too hard for you to wait.

163
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:13,051
It was much harder...

164
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,151
than waiting.

165
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,671
It was...

166
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,641
so hard for me too.

167
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,710
That's why...

168
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,051
I was looking for a way to come back.

169
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,751
Even if my dad didn't wake up,

170
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:49,021
I would've come back to you.

171
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,891
What if I had gotten over you?

172
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,761
I would've followed you around.

173
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,061
What if I still said no?

174
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,460
I would've cried and begged,

175
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:02,031
and tried to seduce you.

176
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:05,600
Ju Kyung.

177
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:08,870
Please look at me.

178
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,811
I'm sorry for making you...

179
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:17,480
suffer.

180
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,480
Why are you sorry?

181
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,850
I know how you felt.

182
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,291
I do, but seeing you again,

183
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,131
I'm reminded of how much it hurt.

184
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,431
I'm sorry for hurting you.

185
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,200
You were hurting too.

186
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,840
It must've been so hard in that faraway land.

187
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,641
You had no other family.

188
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:45,710
You were in the hospital alone, unable to do anything.

189
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,710
It must've hurt so much.

190
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,681
I was so worried, that I wanted to fly over, but...

191
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,651
An 18-year-old has no money.

192
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,031
We were too young,

193
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,141
- weren't we? - Yes.

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,700
Don't cry.

195
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,271
Come here.

196
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,950
It's shocking enough that they were dating.

197
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,751
It's amazing that they're getting married.

198
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,521
I know. Who else could handle my sister other than Mr. Han?

199
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,401
What are you staring at?

200
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,631
What? It's just...

201
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,570
you've changed a lot.

202
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
You even drive now.

203
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,521
I still have this too.

204
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,251
You didn't throw it away.

205
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,691
We're the same.

206
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:08,991
What?

207
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,031
We haven't changed...

208
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,531
from before.

209
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,170
From before, when?

210
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,001
When you were a crybaby?

211
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,241
I cried once. Stop calling me a crybaby.

212
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,511
You really are a crybaby.

213
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,511
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

214
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,781
I wouldn't have known if I didn't see the writing on the wall.

215
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,350
I wanted to tell you on a special day, but couldn't.

216
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,051
You should've just told me.

217
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,360
I liked you when I was a kid too.

218
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,860
I used to wait for you at the comic book store every day.

219
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,471
I guess it wasn't one-sided...

220
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,001
if you remembered me.

221
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:55,811
I didn't like you.

222
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,981
I only remember you as the comic book store crybaby.

223
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:04,180
That's sad. I guess it was an unrequited love.

224
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,691
How do you feel? Are you still sick?

225
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,350
What do you mean?

226
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,061
I wasn't sick.

227
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,860
You ended up in the ER. How's your constipation?

228
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,231
It's fine.

229
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,070
You should exercise often and eat a lot of fiber.

230
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,130
You need probiotics and lots of water.

231
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,570
You need to do that regularly so you don't get constipated...

232
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,541
Hey. Must you kill the mood by talking about that?

233
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,511
It's so embarrassing.

234
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,880
It's because I've been under a lot of stress.

235
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,011
People with active digestive systems are usually very active.

236
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,350
Pull over. I'll walk home as a workout.

237
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,221
Yes. Over there. You can drop me off there.

238
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,491
Pull over there.

239
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,330
- Hey. - Are you on your way home?

240
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,130
Yes, I am.

241
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,100
- Aren't you tired? - Not at all.

242
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
Is it hard to talk because you're driving?

243
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,670
- Want to call me when you get home? - No.

244
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,711
It's fine.

245
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,640
I want to keep hearing your voice.

246
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,110
What are you doing tomorrow?

247
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,281
Why?

248
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,491
I want to go see you.

249
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,360
It seems like a dream...

250
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,320
that I can see you tomorrow.

251
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,231
For me too.

252
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,056
When you start the chorus,

253
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,096
- give a drum roll. - Here.

254
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,727
- To explode. - Yes.

255
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,197
And here, the guitar...

256
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,636
- Don't pause on D, go right in. - Go right in.

257
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,207
Why did you have to come out right then?

258
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,477
You made me look lame.

259
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:07,447
- What do you mean? - Unbelievable.

260
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,187
Today was my last chance, you know.

261
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:16,457
What I didn't do two years ago... Telling her how I feel...

262
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,227
and getting rejected.

263
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,096
I finally got to do it.

264
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,187
What are you doing here?

265
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,267
I'm not busy today,

266
00:21:58,697 --> 00:21:59,997
so I'll let you say what you couldn't yesterday.

267
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:04,806
I honestly don't know what to say.

268
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,076
As if.

269
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,576
It's already written all over your face.

270
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,816
You've always been one to wear your heart on your sleeves.

271
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,046
All I can say to you...

272
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:18,217
is that I'm grateful and sorry.

273
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,457
As if that's something to be sorry about.

274
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,086
I was aware...

275
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:25,556
that you weren't over Soo Ho.

276
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,167
So don't be sorry.

277
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:32,866
You had no room for me in your heart,

278
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:35,306
but I tried getting greedy for once.

279
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,737
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,306
I'm the one who should apologize...

281
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,106
for confusing you by telling you how I feel.

282
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:46,046
You must want me to mean that,

283
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,747
but that'd be ridiculous.

284
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:49,687
I should at least tell you how I feel.

285
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,457
Your brother once said to me...

286
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:58,026
that getting rejected helps you to move on.

287
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:02,427
Don't worry though. My debut is imminent,

288
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,397
so I won't have time to think about you.

289
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,136
I'll move on quicker than you think.

290
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,267
Keep holding that expression though, and I'll go.

291
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:14,407
- Should I? - Okay, let's finish our drinks.

292
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,447
- It'll be on me. - Got it.

293
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,397
Let's go.

294
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,927
Are you playing me for a fool already?

295
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,667
- Please let me go. - I'll bet all my aroma candles...

296
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,566
on you having not-so-innocent intentions.

297
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:43,636
What will you bet in return?

298
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,836
Stop that already!

299
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:48,846
What are you doing in that suit of yours?

300
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,747
I wanted to practice walking Hee Kyung down the aisle.

301
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,816
What for? She and Joon Woo will be doing that themselves.

302
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,386
Breakfast is ready!

303
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,217
Why though?

304
00:23:58,217 --> 00:23:59,917
A lot of couples do that these days.

305
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:01,316
You're here again, Soo Ho?

306
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:02,556
Did you sleep in again?

307
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:05,356
You've been here almost every day for the past month.

308
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:08,897
Why don't you just marry her instead?

309
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,826
You must think you're immune to pain.

310
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,937
It'll be nice to get it over with.

311
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,267
I won't allow it so easily.

312
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,566
When should I pick you up today?

313
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,336
It's all right. You'll probably be too tired.

314
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:21,636
I'll be fine.

315
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:23,747
It's what I expected from you.

316
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,677
Back is the man who is young, rich, and handsome.

317
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,276
I envy how you don't have to work to earn money.

318
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:30,147
Your CSAT should be what you only think about.

319
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,917
I studied until after midnight last night.

320
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,056
Nobody's more desperate than I am right now.

321
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,257
As if Go Woon will wait until you get into college.

322
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,227
Must you be so annoying, you jerk?

323
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,897
You jerk? To your sister?

324
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,566
Why do you keep acting like his brother-in-law?

325
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:44,897
Now, dig in.

326
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:45,997
Sure.

327
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:49,066
(Move Entertainment)

328
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,036
(New Idol Group Makeup Concept Contest)

329
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,207
A makeup concept contest for a new idol group?

330
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,316
Chen, filming has been pushed back a little.

331
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:04,247
- Can you wait? - Sure.

332
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,286
Just a second. Hello?

333
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:12,457
Ju Kyung, are you and Seo Jun dating?

334
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:14,826
No.

335
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:18,296
Of course. I knew he had high standards.

336
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:21,437
That's right. And because of his high standards,

337
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,907
he'd never date just about anyone.

338
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,507
Mist.

339
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,207
Enough!

340
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:33,417
I didn't know I was at a sauna. Go easy on it, will you?

341
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,497
Why does she have to follow us everywhere?

342
00:25:48,626 --> 00:25:49,967
She only takes up room in the van.

343
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,796
It's not like she does any work.

344
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,836
She's an intern and needs to learn the ropes.

345
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:56,836
I know, but why does it have to be on my time?

346
00:25:57,066 --> 00:26:00,237
Even professionals can't meet all my demands perfectly,

347
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:04,076
so it annoys me to bits to have a rookie tail us.

348
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,717
What a brat.

349
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,076
I knew you'd be kind and understand.

350
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,356
Then, since I'm hungry,

351
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:14,086
get me a roll of gimbap.

352
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:15,987
With cheese.

353
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,066
I delivered dumplings in high school...

354
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,536
and now I'm buying someone else's gimbap.

355
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:35,947
Hurry up, will you?

356
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,147
Sorry.

357
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:43,816
Are you kidding me? Don't you know I hate cucumbers?

358
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,816
You should've had them taken out.

359
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,816
Sorry. I didn't know you disliked them.

360
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:50,687
Should I buy you another?

361
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,697
Just get in and pick the cucumbers out.

362
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:53,897
I'm starving.

363
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:58,497
What is it?

364
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:00,897
Pick out the cucumbers for me.

365
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:02,667
Do it yourself.

366
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:06,677
Ju Kyung, I'm Chen.

367
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,707
Must I spend my time picking out cucumbers?

368
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,276
Do it yourself, darn it.

369
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,816
You have hands, don't you?

370
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:15,276
I didn't study makeup to pick out your cucumbers.

371
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,717
How dare you abuse your power?

372
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:19,187
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:21,257
- Do you want to get fired? - I'd rather quit...

374
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:22,626
than get fired by you,

375
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:24,457
you obnoxious brat!

376
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:26,957
What? How dare you!

377
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,497
Why? What's going on?

378
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,667
- It's her. - Seriously?

379
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,397
Who do you think you are?

380
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,306
What did you do to her?

381
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:38,036
That's enough!

382
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,177
Chen, you too.

383
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:40,576
Stop playing the victim, darn it.

384
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,306
You must be out of your mind.

385
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:44,407
What did you just say?

386
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:45,507
Hey.

387
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:51,217
Who are you laying hands on, you thug?

388
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:53,286
Kang Soo Jin?

389
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,227
Are you all right?

390
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:58,126
Are you hurt?

391
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:03,826
Have you been well?

392
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,296
I guess.

393
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,366
What about you? How have you been?

394
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,306
After dropping out of school,

395
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,576
Mom and I went to stay with my aunt overseas.

396
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,876
My parents got divorced, you see.

397
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,776
You must be attending college then.

398
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:21,447
No, I've been doing volunteer work overseas.

399
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,046
I only recently got back from Haiti.

400
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:25,717
I see.

401
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:28,616
No wonder.

402
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:33,326
No one had heard from you, so I got curious.

403
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:35,056
That's because I never told anyone.

404
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,197
Now that I'm back, I wanted to apologize to you.

405
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,467
It's why I asked around to figure out where you worked.

406
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:43,667
Ju Kyung,

407
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:45,806
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:48,776
I'm sorry it took me so long to apologize.

409
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:53,677
I'm really sorry.

410
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:56,747
This isn't so that you'd forgive me.

411
00:28:57,046 --> 00:28:58,116
Soo Jin...

412
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,187
I must've been a mess back then.

413
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,386
It seemed like you had what I couldn't have,

414
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,657
so I felt like I lost again.

415
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:09,796
Stealing what you had and stomping on your relationship...

416
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,227
seemed like a way of winning.

417
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,866
I always had to be on top of everyone.

418
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:18,437
That's what I was taught.

419
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,647
Getting away from my father finally let me see...

420
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,846
how deeply I hurt you back then...

421
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:30,687
and what I had lost.

422
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:34,086
I regretted my actions...

423
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:36,886
and tried to apologize to you,

424
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:40,826
but it didn't seem right to say over the phone.

425
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,326
I also thought you'd ignore my calls too.

426
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:47,397
You should've called.

427
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,566
I would've loved to hear from you.

428
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:55,876
Maybe I should've.

429
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:04,286
I'm all right.

430
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,286
It doesn't faze me anymore.

431
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,657
Those memories...

432
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,957
don't hurt me as much anymore.

433
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:17,826
I guess that's why I don't even hate you.

434
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:23,306
Still, I'm glad that I was able to see you...

435
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,007
and apologize in person.

436
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,776
I'm happier for you, you know.

437
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,806
You're free now.

438
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:33,376
Your hands have healed as well.

439
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:38,017
They're pretty.

440
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:41,917
I know.

441
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:47,697
Your kick is still just as threatening.

442
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:49,427
I let my temper get the best of me.

443
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,066
I hope I didn't make things worse for you.

444
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,997
All they can do is fire me anyway, so I'm good.

445
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:00,836
- That song? - Of course.

446
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:02,376
It was my personal choice.

447
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,647
I've been a fan of Leo's songs for a very long time.

448
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,977
You and Se Yeon made that song together.

449
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:09,816
And I think it'd be meaningful to let Seo Jun sing it.

450
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:12,987
Don't you feel bad about leaving it as a plagiarized song?

451
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,457
I'm sure you're upset about it too.

452
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,257
Why are you so serious?

453
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:21,227
I just can't believe it.

454
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,667
I've never studied music.

455
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,237
The only lessons I got were from Se Yeon.

456
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:27,997
Seo Jun already told me everything.

457
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,306
He told me it's easy to tell how much you love music...

458
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,136
judging by the instruments and equipment you own.

459
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:36,276
If we don't like your song, we're not going to release it.

460
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:37,977
So don't get too ahead of yourself.

461
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:43,147
I want to hear Leo's version of "Missing You".

462
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:45,286
Don't feel too pressured and just send us the song.

463
00:31:46,086 --> 00:31:47,217
Okay?

464
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:50,257
Okay then. That's enough about work.

465
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:52,626
Can I open my wedding gift?

466
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:54,356
Sure.

467
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,366
Why is it so heavy?

468
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,677
You chose the best gift ever.

469
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:12,106
Congratulations on your wedding.

470
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,917
I have so many things to fix at home.

471
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,556
I want to hear Leo's version of "Missing You".

472
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:31,927
Passcode confirmed.

473
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:07,667
The purple sky

474
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:15,607
And the cool breeze makes me feel more lonely

475
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:22,817
All the familiar memories

476
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:28,986
Start coming back and remind me of you tonight

477
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:36,826
I have so much to thank you for

478
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,167
Our hearts used to flutter

479
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:44,767
As we smiled at one another

480
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,136
I fear

481
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,937
Who's the guy? What's his name?

482
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:51,047
Soo Jin already gave him a good kick in the face.

483
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:54,846
I'm glad she did. If I were there, I would've beaten him...

484
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,986
You wouldn't have beaten him to a pulp.

485
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,647
Fortunately, I didn't get fired.

486
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,857
But I am getting punished for it.

487
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:03,926
I need to finish this. I'll call you back later.

488
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:11,527
What are you doing?

489
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:14,767
I'm washing the makeup brushes and sponges.

490
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,506
You're doing it all alone?

491
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:19,906
What are you doing?

492
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,207
This is latex. If you wash it with hot water, it shrinks.

493
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:25,946
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:30,087
You need to divide them into natural and synthetic brushes first.

495
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:32,517
You need to wash them differently, so don't get them mixed up.

496
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:33,986
Okay.

497
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:35,957
Was your name Lim Su Jeong?

498
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,127
No, I'm Lim Ju Kyung.

499
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:40,696
Were you the one who yelled at Chen earlier?

500
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,196
I'm really sorry about that as well.

501

Ms. Lim Kyung Ja, can't you read?

509
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,346
- Pardon? - It says all the employees...

510
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,386
are allowed to enter. Didn't you see that?

511
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,926
Thank you! I'll do my best!

Hey, look at him.

514
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,506
He's so handsome. Who is she?

515
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,076
- Do you think she's his girlfriend? - She's probably just a friend.

516
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,216
Did I keep you waiting?

517
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:40,417
Honey, what took you so long?

518
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,716
I waited for you.

519
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:44,056
Honey, did you eat?

520
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,096
Here. Try a bite.

521
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,826
- Let's get back to this. - She's his girlfriend.

522
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,736
Did you just get jealous?

523
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,777
Honey?

524
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,747
I didn't get jealous.

525
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,417
Don't go around with a smile on your face from now on, okay?

526
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:11,047
I think those middle school kids made you get jealous.

527
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:14,286
Honey.

528
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,056
Cut it out, Soo Ho.

529
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:18,786
Honey, why don't you try calling me "Honey" again?

530
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,056
Forget it.

531
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,196
- Should I give it a try? - Give what a try?

532
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,196
Are you going to call me "Honey"?

533
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,267
I haven't done a lot of makeup on guys,

534
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:29,397
so I'm not used to it.

535
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,636
- It tickles. - Stay still.

536
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:35,877
Let me try this properly.

537
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,977
It doesn't always come out the way I imagine it.

538

You're a terrible model.

00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:50,227
Okay, nice! I love it! 1, 2.

542
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,756
Good. Look over here. 1, 2, 3. Okay. 1, 2.

I love how you guys are posing right now. Give me a smile.

Look here and give me a smile.

She gave me a credit card.

Then buy both. Just buy everything.

00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:18,477
or party it up?

665
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:22,846
I did not care!

666
00:43:23,587 --> 00:43:25,647
You know you dumped me 17 times.

667
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,957
You can beg all you want. I won't take you back.

668
00:43:28,957 --> 00:43:31,656
- Then why are you following me? - It's late...

669
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:36,527
It's dangerous. I can't let you go alone.

670
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:39,196
Whatever.

671
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:44,906
I love you.

672
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:49,736
Soo Ho.

673
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:52,877
Let's go.

674
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:54,676
Thank you.

675
00:43:58,317 --> 00:43:59,417
Come here.

676
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,756
Don't you dare drink like this again.

677
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:08,156
Ju Kyung.

678
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,075
Where are we?

679
00:44:12,244 --> 00:44:15,385
This? This is your home.

680
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:17,255
- I'm dizzy. - Careful.

681
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,885
Okay. Careful.

682
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:25,095
Gosh. Okay.

683
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:35,604
Wait. This...

684
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:39,235
I was lucky enough to get it, but you can have it.

685
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:43,515
You know my secret now, so I should be nice to you.

686
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:47,215
So this is where you put it.

687
00:44:57,024 --> 00:45:00,624
Look at him smile while he's drunk. This will not do.

688
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:02,494
I said not to smile like that.

689
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,735
Who are you?

690
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:09,434
- What? - Who are you, that you came...

691
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:11,135
into my home?

692
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:14,575
- I'm Lim Ju Kyung. - Lim Ju Kyung?

693
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:18,215
My girlfriend's name is also Lim Ju Kyung.

694
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:23,084
You're pretty too.

695
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:24,814
Am I?

696
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:27,624
Then will you break up with your girlfriend...

697
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,024
and go out with me?

698
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:30,854
No.

699
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,695
I belong to Lim Ju Kyung.

700
00:45:34,325 --> 00:45:35,524
What a shame.

701
00:45:37,494 --> 00:45:39,765
Then I'll get going now.

702
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,035
Good night.

703
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:44,635
Wait.

704
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:47,575
Come here.

705
00:45:55,785 --> 00:45:58,814
I love you so much

706
00:45:58,814 --> 00:46:00,825
Oh dear

707
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,755
Stop it. You're making me cringe.

708
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:06,394
I love you so much

709
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:08,894
Oh dear

710
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:11,695
You're a completely different person when you're drunk.

711
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:18,334
Ju Kyung.

712
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,244
You know...

713
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:25,974
that song I wrote with Se Yeon?

714
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:29,885
Seo Jun is going to sing it.

715
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:32,615
Really?

716
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:37,894
Would Se Yeon...

717
00:46:39,624 --> 00:46:40,724
like that too?

718
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:45,695
Of course. That's a given.

719
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:48,235
Really?

720
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:50,735
Yes, really.

721
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:54,945
I'd be super happy if it were me.

722
00:46:58,075 --> 00:46:59,274
I really...

723
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:02,385
hope you're right.

724
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:39,684
Ju Kyung.

725
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,055
Wake up.

726
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:51,735
Ju Kyung.

727
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:54,235
It's late.

728
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:56,635
Wake up.

729
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:02,644
I tried to wake you.

730
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,945
You're the one who didn't wake up.

731
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:12,215
I love you.

732
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:36,305
- Are you okay? - What?

733
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:39,044
I meant to leave once you fell asleep,

734
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,314
but I fell asleep too.

735
00:48:40,314 --> 00:48:41,785
I was just about to wake you.

736
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:44,515
(3 missed calls from Mom)

737
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:47,825
Mom called.

738
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,354
I didn't say I'd be late.

739
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:51,854
Why didn't you go home?

740
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:54,825
I said you were sleeping over at my place.

741
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:57,494
Enjoy yourself, my friend.

742
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:01,265
Aren't you going to call her?

743
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:03,564
Well...

744
00:49:04,934 --> 00:49:07,675
Soo Ah covered for me.

745
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,005
She did?

746
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:14,785
I'll drive you home. Where's my car key?

747
00:49:15,345 --> 00:49:17,184
Where did I put it?

748
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:18,414
But you drank.

749
00:49:19,215 --> 00:49:20,385
Right.

750
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,454
I should call a designated driver.

751
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,524
I'll just call a cab.

752
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:32,695
I can't get a car. Is it because it's so late?

753
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:40,704
I'll hail one on the street.

754
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:47,644
Can't you stay?

755
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:51,584
It's...

756
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:54,454
late.

757
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:00,724
Don't go.

758
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,224
Are you cooking? I'm amazed.

759
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:08,765
For this simple dish?

760
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:11,195
I'm just adding stuff and pan-frying them.

761
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:15,805
I can barely cook a pot of ramyeon.

762
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:17,774
Then the cooking will be my job, I guess.

763
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:21,544
It looks delicious. Here.

764
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,204
I'm starving.

765
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:25,244
Ta-da.

766
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:28,845
You should slow down.

767
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,084
It's really good.

768
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:32,155
Was it seasoned with magic?

769
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,385
Try the salad too.

770
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:37,024
It's like I said. Fiber is good for constipation.

771
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,374
Just a second.

772
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:00,485
Here.

773
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,055
Because who I see...

774
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:08,624
is Lim Ju Kyung.

775
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:14,294
You still had this?

776
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:16,724
Here.

777
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:20,664
Do you know how to tie hair back?

778
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:22,765
I'm willing to try.

779
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:28,445
Is this not right?

780
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:30,874
Why didn't you throw this out?

781
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:32,615
I'm glad I didn't.

782
00:52:33,845 --> 00:52:36,544
Why don't we watch a movie after I get off work today?

783
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:40,584
Not today. I have something important lined up.

784
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,724
Something important?

785
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:51,164
When I close my eyes, the image of you grows clearer

786
00:52:51,965 --> 00:52:58,405
I end up missing your glowing face even more

787
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:04,374
Where you've been staying up this long night

788
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:12,354
I'll rest for a moment and stay by your side

789
00:53:12,684 --> 00:53:19,325
On this exhausted night, tears let it blossom

790
00:53:20,224 --> 00:53:26,595
When my song reaches the sky

791
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:28,965
Gradually

792
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:30,635
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

793
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:33,434
You sounded amazing.

794
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:37,474
What if you get arrested for pounding on girls' hearts?

795
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:38,845
You and your cheesy comments.

796
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,215
Leo, what did you think?

797
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:42,785
I almost barfed.

798
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:45,354
Because it was that sick.

799
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:47,925
- Do you have a death wish? - Of course not.

800
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:50,854
Pretty Boy 1 and 2, get arguing.

801
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:53,124
I wouldn't mind some blood, sweat, and tears.

802
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:55,064
What? You're not going to vomit again, right?

803
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:56,894
Come on.

804
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:00,535
Anyway, wrap up the recording. I'm getting married tomorrow,

805
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:02,505
- so I'll head home. - Congratulations.

806
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,604
You got lucky with your fiance.

807
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,905
I know. I should make my Grapefruit a happy man.

808
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,805
- I'm off. - Take care.

809
00:54:11,474 --> 00:54:12,774
Darn, I'm starving.

810
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,285
Want to grab a bite?

811
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,885
Is this enough?

812
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:19,684
I can't sing on a full stomach.

813
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:22,854
Your vocalization isn't as good as it used to be.

814
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:26,894
I saw you wiping tears away while hearing me sing earlier.

815
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:27,965
When did I ever?

816
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:33,865
Will I not get to see you often once you make your debut?

817
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:35,434
Of course, I'll be too busy.

818
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,374
You should get in line.

819
00:54:37,735 --> 00:54:39,635
I'll be just as busy too.

820
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:42,005
I'm thinking about studying.

821
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,515
- Studying what? - Music.

822
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,814
I never properly learned how to write songs.

823
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:50,244
So I've decided to start with the basics.

824
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:52,515
Wait. Will you be taking the CSAT then?

825
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,755
Poor Ju Kyung. She'll have to provide for her boyfriend.

826
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,954
I can take the test right now and still get into a decent college.

827
00:54:58,954 --> 00:55:00,524
What a show-off.

828
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,365
Anyway, I'm having some coke.

829
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:05,735
Soda isn't good for your throat, so stick to water.

830
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:07,905
Okay, fine. I'll drink water instead.

831
00:55:08,135 --> 00:55:09,965
No wonder your singing isn't as good as before.

832
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:12,675
You're like a nagging wife.

833
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:15,144
A singer should take care of his voice.

834
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:24,814
(Lim Hee Kyung, Han Joon Woo We're getting married)

835
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:26,084
(Bride: Lim Hee Kyung)

836
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:27,425
(Groom: Han Joon Woo)

837
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:29,124
(Lim Hee Kyung, Han Joon Woo We're getting married)

838
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:35,294
Who on earth is it?

839
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,434
Who have you been texting all day?

840
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,365
- An older student from school. - An older student?

841
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,204
Male or female?

842
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:43,135
Male.

843
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:44,434
Male?

844
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:47,544
Hey! Are you giggling?

845
00:55:48,274 --> 00:55:51,075
You should wait for me until I get into college next year.

846
00:55:51,075 --> 00:55:52,575
No one told you not to get into college.

847
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:55,445
- It's not like I didn't want to. - Whatever.

848
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:59,515
Okay, fine. I'll let you flirt a little.

849
00:55:59,954 --> 00:56:03,055
Enjoy your college life to some extent, okay?

850
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:07,624
Hey, Ju Young.

851
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:09,765
What?

852
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:12,494
I'm aware of how much you like me...

853
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,064
and that I won't find anyone as decent as you.

854
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:19,175
So don't you dare flirt with any girls at the academy.

855
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,805
You'll pay for it.

856
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:25,414
Go Woon!

857
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:31,615
Look at you, Ju Kyung. The studying and the internship...

858
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:33,555
truly paid off.

859
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:35,655
A bride shouldn't speak in that tone.

860
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,285
Stay still, will you?

861
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:40,454
My Hee Kyung couldn't be more stunning.

862
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,494
What's wrong with me?

863
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:46,135
I honestly shouldn't cry.

864
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:48,635
Talk about the roles being reversed.

865
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:50,135
How adorable.

866
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,845
- What's that, Dad? - His eyes are puffy from the tears.

867
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:59,715
They're less puffy now and...

868
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:06,684
Why do you keep on crying?

869
00:57:06,854 --> 00:57:10,055
You just had to marry a man exactly like your dad.

870
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,624
- All done. - Really?

871
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:15,794
Is this really me?

872
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:19,135
- Hyun Sook. - You're here!

873
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,664
- Hello. - You look amazing. Congratulations.

874
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:23,965
- Where's Seo Jun? - I came with Go Woon.

875
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:26,474
Seo Jun's busy getting ready for his debut.

876
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:29,005
You look stunning.

877
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:30,675
- Divine Hyun Kyu. - Yes, Mighty Tae Hoon?

878
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:33,015
What gives? Why didn't you bring your girlfriend?

879
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:35,744
She's busy, you see.

880
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:37,954
You lied, didn't you?

881
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,184
You lied about having one...

882
00:57:39,184 --> 00:57:40,454
to get out of going to the military together.

883
00:57:40,454 --> 00:57:43,624
Where did you find this odd ring anyway?

884
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:45,524
- Is it your dad's? - My dad's?

885
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:47,155
I got it in Dongdaemun...

886
00:57:47,155 --> 00:57:48,825
- and it's 18k gold. - Whatever.

887
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:50,064
As if you'll know.

888
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:53,765
Hoon, you look incredible in that suit.

889
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,564
Hold on. Why are you calling him like that again?

890
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,905
You only used to when you dated.

891
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:00,075
- Are you two back together? - What?

892
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:03,774
When did I call him Hoon? You should get your ears checked.

893
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:06,044
That's odd. You don't call him Hoon for no reason.

894
00:58:06,075 --> 00:58:08,615
- What do you mean it's odd? - Hey, it's been so long!

895
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,345
- Unbelievable. - Hey, Hyun Kyu.

896
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,785
It's so good to see you again.

897
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:23,965
Soo Ah, your hand is bigger than I remember it.

898
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,164
What do you think you're doing?

899
00:58:26,695 --> 00:58:28,664
How dare you take my girlfriend's hand!

900
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:30,664
I didn't mean to... Wait, girlfriend?

901
00:58:30,664 --> 00:58:31,874
Stop it.

902
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:34,374
You've always been at each other's throats,

903
00:58:34,374 --> 00:58:35,474
so when did this happen?

904
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,374
You said it would never happen. I can't believe this.

905
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:40,814
- I told you to be careful! - No way.

906
00:58:41,244 --> 00:58:43,244
- Honey! - Honey?

907
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:45,655
Are you ashamed of me or something?

908
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:47,655
- Whatever. - No way.

909
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:49,755
Guys.

910
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:53,624
Watch us become the sweetest couple.

911
00:58:54,055 --> 00:58:55,265
- No... - Please don't.

912
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,635
Hey. Don't you dare!

913
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:58,865
What do you think you're doing?

914
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:00,195
- I can't believe it. - Unbelievable.

915
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:01,535
Hoon, let's go.

916
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,405
- I can't watch this. - Are you kidding me?

917
00:59:04,505 --> 00:59:05,934
Ju Kyung.

918
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:08,445
Hey, you're here.

919
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:10,374
Are you done with her makeup?

920
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:12,044
I don't know why I'm so nervous...

921
00:59:12,044 --> 00:59:13,774
when Hee Kyung's the one getting married.

922
00:59:14,044 --> 00:59:16,584
Are the contest results out? Today's the day, right?

923
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:19,314
Yes, the results were posted.

924
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:20,385
So how did it go?

925
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:21,885
Well...

926
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:24,425
Good or bad?

927
00:59:26,755 --> 00:59:28,695
- So you made the cut. - No, I didn't.

928
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:31,235
- You didn't? - The others are more experienced,

929
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,535
so it only makes sense.

930
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,965
You must feel defeated. I know how hard you tried.

931
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:36,905
Still, I feel good about it.

932
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:39,204
The internship will be over once lectures begin again,

933
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:42,144
so I wanted to do more than just run errands all the time.

934
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:43,974
I learned a lot while putting the presentation together.

935
00:59:43,974 --> 00:59:45,274
I'm proud of you.

936
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,044
I was wrong to go with the model I chose though.

937
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:52,555
- Why? - People asked me more about you...

938
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,385
after seeing your photo.

939
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,755
They asked me where I found you.

940
00:59:57,285 --> 00:59:58,825
So it's because of you that I didn't pass.

941
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:01,164
- Is it? - Yes.

942
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,334
- What can I do to make up for it? - I'm not sure.

943
01:00:05,365 --> 01:00:07,635
Soo Ho, my best friend.

944
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:10,265
You guys are so pretty and handsome today.

945
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:12,874
- It's like you're getting married. - Exactly.

946
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:17,305
Soo Jin.

947
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,414
My gosh, is that Kang Soo Jin?

948
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:24,655
You haven't changed one bit.

949
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:27,184
Long time no see, Kang Soo.

950
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,084
I haven't heard anyone call me that in a long time.

951
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:34,095
I'm glad you came. Soo Ah wanted to meet you too.

952
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:37,195
Have you been well?

953
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:39,035
I heard about your dad.

954
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:41,265
- I'm relieved. - Me too.

955
01:00:42,064 --> 01:00:43,204
Thanks.

956
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:47,704
I missed you.

957
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:50,244
You should've called.

958
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:53,314
I'm sorry.

959
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,084
How cute.

960
01:00:56,744 --> 01:00:58,655
Hee Kyung, your ring is here.

961
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,024
Thank goodness it got here on time.

962
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,524
- Try it on to see if it fits. - Okay.

963
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,454
- It's a bit tight. - What?

964
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,224
- It won't come off. - What?

965
01:01:09,325 --> 01:01:11,064
It's because you drank yesterday.

966
01:01:11,064 --> 01:01:12,664
What kind of bride drinks before her own wedding?

967
01:01:12,664 --> 01:01:14,334
It really won't come off. Take it off for me.

968
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:15,434
- My goodness. - Let me see.

969
01:01:16,135 --> 01:01:17,834
Gosh, it really won't come off.

970
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,505
Why don't I just wear it?

971
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:21,575
You can't do that.

972
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:24,305
Exchanging rings is the most important part of the wedding.

973
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:27,175
- He's right. Here. Let me try. - You want to try?

974
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:29,515
I'll get it off for you.

975
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,555
I think my finger might come off.

976
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:35,255
- Honey, be gentle. - Gosh, it hurts.

977
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:37,854
- Be gentle. - I'll get it off for you!

978
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:41,024
- My gosh, it hurts! - My goodness.

979
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:44,735
You got it off!

980
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:49,535
There it is.

981
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,015
It's time for the bride to go to the waiting room.

982
01:01:58,015 --> 01:01:59,115
I got you.

983
01:02:03,144 --> 01:02:04,215
What's going on?

984
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:07,755
- What's wrong? - What is it?

985
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:08,954
Darn it.

986
01:02:11,555 --> 01:02:12,794
Hee Kyung, congratulations...

987
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,024
What's going on?

988
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,365
- Isn't it the bride's waiting room? - What's the groom doing there?

989
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:20,735
Hello.

990
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:22,704
My gosh, what's all this?

991
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:25,035
I didn't know grooms also had waiting rooms these days.

992
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:27,704
Bravo. Mr. Han, you look amazing.

993
01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:29,044
Congratulations.

994
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:31,675
- Thank you. - I'll take a photo of everyone.

995
01:02:31,675 --> 01:02:33,845
- Stand next to the groom. - Okay, let's go.

996
01:02:33,945 --> 01:02:35,115
Be careful.

997
01:02:35,615 --> 01:02:36,885
You can sit here.

998
01:02:38,084 --> 01:02:39,285
I'll take a photo now.

999
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:41,925
1, 2, 3.

1000
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,024
What's wrong?

1001
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:47,095
- My goodness. - Are you okay?

1002
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:50,624
- My goodness! - Please let go.

1003
01:02:50,624 --> 01:02:52,294
It's time for the groom to get ready to walk down the aisle.

1004
01:02:52,294 --> 01:02:53,465
Okay.

1005
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:57,735
Please! I'm the groom!

1006
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:02,274
- Come on! - This isn't working!

1007
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:03,744
Has her face gotten bigger?

1008
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:06,144
What are we going to do? Should we call someone?

1009
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:07,675
Should we call 911?

1010
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:10,644
- 911? - But she needs to go right now.

1011
01:03:10,644 --> 01:03:11,715
What?

1012
01:03:11,715 --> 01:03:13,555
It's finally time to see...

1013
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:16,354
the bride and groom walk down the aisle.

1014
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:19,695
I'd like everyone to face the back.

1015
01:03:19,854 --> 01:03:23,595
Okay then. Let's give them a round of applause...

1016
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,095
and welcome them...

1017
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:28,265
with excitement as we keep our voices up on note C7.

1018
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:30,604
Let's welcome the bride and groom.

1019
01:03:40,314 --> 01:03:43,814
This is the most beautiful wedding I've ever seen.

1020
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:46,655
Let's give them a round of applause!

1021
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:54,595
I love your voices.

1022
01:04:00,765 --> 01:04:04,104
Now that the wedding has come to an end,

1023
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:07,474
it's time for the officiant to give them his words of blessings.

1024
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:10,204
The fact that I was given the opportunity...

1025
01:04:10,204 --> 01:04:13,675
to officiate Han Joon Woo...

1026
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:16,615
and Lim Hee Kyung's wedding...

1027
01:04:16,615 --> 01:04:20,385
makes me feel unbelievably grateful and honored.

1028
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:23,084
Let me tell you something about the groom, Han Joon Woo.

1029
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:27,024
The moment he set foot into Saebom High School,

1030
01:04:27,024 --> 01:04:28,524
I saw a halo,

1031
01:04:28,524 --> 01:04:32,265
and I could instantly tell that he had the competence...

1032
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:35,204
to lead our school to create...

1033
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,064
a new history!

1034
01:04:37,064 --> 01:04:39,505
Now let's see how much the bride loves the groom...

1035
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:42,204
by hearing her shout her love for him three times.

1036
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:45,744
Han Joon is my man! Han Joon is my man!

1037
01:04:45,744 --> 01:04:49,285
- Han Joon is my man! I love you! - Congratulations!

1038
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,425
- Kiss! Kiss! - Kiss! Kiss!

1039
01:04:58,755 --> 01:05:00,124
- Kiss! Kiss! - No...

1040
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:03,325
Let's congratulate them with a round of applause!

1041
01:05:58,314 --> 01:05:59,584
Amazing!

1042
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,715
I'll go wash the sponges.

1043
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:19,925
Seo Jun.

1044
01:08:20,525 --> 01:08:22,425
Hey, you're here too?

1045
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:24,725
You look great today.

1046
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,595
It's not just today.

1047
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:28,704
I look great every day.

1048
01:08:30,534 --> 01:08:31,734
Seo Jun, are you done?

1049
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:34,105
- Let's begin. - Okay.

1050
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:52,324
I see you're on your toes today.

1051
01:09:12,675 --> 01:09:14,145
Which color do you think we should use?

1052
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:16,645
Pardon? Me?

1053
01:09:16,845 --> 01:09:18,484
Who else would I be talking to?

1054
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:21,355
Well...

1055
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:26,895
In order to match the color of his hair and outfit,

1056
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,164
I think we should use one that's a bit more matte.

1057
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:34,494
Why don't you give it a try?

1058
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:38,305
- Me? - Who else would I be talking to?

1059
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:41,505
Here. I heard you guys are friends.

1060
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:43,145
Give it a nice finishing touch.

1061
01:09:51,315 --> 01:09:52,355
About the concept proposal...

1062
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,755
You did pretty well for an intern,

1063
01:09:56,824 --> 01:09:57,954
Ju Kyung.

1064
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,824
- What are you doing? - Hey.

1065
01:10:04,265 --> 01:10:06,734
She just said my name and complimented me, right?

1066
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:07,834
I'm not dreaming, am I?

1067
01:10:08,565 --> 01:10:09,734
Look at this girl.

1068
01:10:10,435 --> 01:10:13,135
You don't know how it feels for a geek who succeeded.

1069
01:10:15,704 --> 01:10:17,044
Finish it already.

1070
01:10:18,105 --> 01:10:19,275
Okay.

1071
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:28,324
Do you have tremors?

1072
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:31,954
It's my first time doing this at a real event.

1073
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:34,694
You did it well last time.

1074
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:36,425
It's different.

1075
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:38,994
You can't mess it up even if you mess up.

1076
01:10:39,465 --> 01:10:41,234
My lips are too sexy for that.

1077
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:45,034
Stay still.

1078
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:02,784
All done.

1079
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,154
Thanks.

1080
01:11:06,654 --> 01:11:09,565
I didn't do anything. Perform well. I'll be watching.

1081
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:10,824
Don't be nervous.

1082
01:11:11,994 --> 01:11:13,194
You too. Good luck.

1083
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:15,334
Good luck.

1084
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:17,765
Your hand is sweaty.

1085
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,005
You're nervous, aren't you?

1086
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:22,805
I am not. I've got nerves of steel.

1087
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:24,374
I don't get nervous.

1088
01:11:34,185 --> 01:11:35,525
Let's go!

1089
01:11:40,154 --> 01:11:41,965
- Let's do this. - Hands in.

1090
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:45,435
We've worked hard, so let's do our best.

1091
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,234
- Let's do a cheer. - Okay. 1, 2, 3.

1092
01:11:47,234 --> 01:11:48,265
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

1093
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:52,834
Hey.

1094
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,204
- Did you finish? - Yes. I did Seo Jun's lips.

1095
01:11:57,175 --> 01:11:58,204
What about me?

1096
01:12:00,074 --> 01:12:01,175
It's starting.

1097
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:31,105
The purple sky

1098
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:38,145
And the cool breeze makes me feel more lonely

1099
01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:44,885
All the familiar memories

1100
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:51,124
Start coming back and remind me of you tonight

1101
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:59,475
I have so much to thank you for

1102
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:06,444
Our hearts used to flutter as we smiled at one another

1103
01:13:06,444 --> 01:13:13,154
I fear you'll turn into a star and disappear again

1104
01:13:13,414 --> 01:13:19,654
I'll cherish you in the void in my heart

1105
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:27,834
When I close my eyes, the image of you grows clearer

1106
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:34,904
I end up missing your glowing face even more

1107
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:40,944
Where you've been staying up this long night

1108
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:48,755
I'll rest for a moment and stay by your side

1109
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:55,994
On this exhausted night, tears let it blossom

1110
01:13:56,794 --> 01:14:03,204
When my song reaches the sky

1111
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:10,675
Gradually Come to me like an eternal dream

1112
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:16,444
Become a star and stay by my side

1113
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,334
You rock!

1114
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:40,534
As if I roamed in the darkness for years

1115
01:14:41,534 --> 01:14:45,275
And finally found light

1116
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:48,645
All the hardships that weighed me down

1117
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:54,055
Melt away like snow

1118
01:14:54,084 --> 01:14:58,925
My dream of hope gave me the strength to fight

1119
01:14:59,055 --> 01:15:03,225
- The countless tears - The countless tears

1120
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:08,904
Relying on my hopeless dream

1121
01:15:09,135 --> 01:15:13,775
I gave my heart and jumped in

1122
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:17,944
It starts today

1123
01:15:17,944 --> 01:15:24,084
A new world slowly appears before my eyes

1124
01:15:24,414 --> 01:15:30,755
And in it, I'll run afresh

1125
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:36,324
My future that I feared

1126
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:37,624
You're awesome!

1127
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:40,234
One by one

1128
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:43,305
They're coming true

1129
01:15:43,534 --> 01:15:49,374
The dreams that I had wished for so desperately

1130
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:52,544
They come to me

1131
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:55,815
Within reach

1132
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:06,124
I didn't finish yet.

1133
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:12,395
- Did you finish? - Not yet.

1134
01:16:12,994 --> 01:16:14,194
You're so slow.

1135
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:16,435
You said you were a master of speed-reading.

1136
01:16:16,834 --> 01:16:19,334
I'm focusing carefully on each page.

1137
01:16:20,305 --> 01:16:22,744
Do you just look at the pictures?

1138
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:24,675
That's disrespectful.

1139
01:16:24,675 --> 01:16:26,244
I really am a master of speed-reading.

1140
01:16:27,244 --> 01:16:28,784
You're so arrogant.

1141
01:16:30,145 --> 01:16:32,154
They wrote this really well.

1142
01:16:32,414 --> 01:16:35,084
They revised "Killer of Darkness" into a zombie story.

1143
01:16:35,284 --> 01:16:36,755
They did a great job.

1144
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:39,624
Really? I wondered why they felt the need to change it.

1145
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:43,095
I feel like it lost the charm of the original that created...

1146
01:16:43,095 --> 01:16:46,334
an eerie fear of the unknown beings by making them zombies.

1147
01:16:47,095 --> 01:16:50,265
True. The original is good in many ways too.

1148
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:52,874
You know the book from 1921 by Ed Seller...

1149
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:53,975
- "Dead of Night." - "Dead of Night."

1150
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:56,275
- So you do know. - How could I not?

1151
01:16:56,505 --> 01:16:58,145
The writing style is still not outdated...

1152
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:00,275
Okay, okay. Let's finish reading. I want to see the rest.

1153
01:17:00,544 --> 01:17:01,675
Flip the page.

1154
01:17:03,645 --> 01:17:05,584
I'm done. Flip the page.

1155
01:17:07,954 --> 01:17:09,355
Seriously.

1156
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,525
What are you two doing?

1157
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:18,025
Nothing. Gosh, this thing.

1158
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:25,234
Sorry. Continue what you were doing. I'm going to go eat.

1159
01:17:26,034 --> 01:17:27,404
I'm going to eat a multi-course meal.

1160
01:17:32,574 --> 01:17:33,574
Shall we continue?

1161
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:37,414
Silly. Forget it.

1162
01:17:42,355 --> 01:17:43,425
Found it.

1163
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,494
(Thank you Go Woo Ri and Dayoung for the special appearance.)

1164
01:18:59,164 --> 01:19:01,834
(Thank you actors and staff for following rules to stop the spread.)

1165
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:06,334
(Thank you for supporting and watching "True Beauty".)

1166
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:31,765

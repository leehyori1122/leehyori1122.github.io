1
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:08,883
You said your private class
will be done at six o'clock, right?

2
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:11,152
Yes, what do you think
will be served for dinner?

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:13,176
Are you going straight
to the library?

4
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:16,390
Don't skip meals because you're
busy. Make sure you come!

5
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,414
Going to eat
will take up so much time.

6
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:22,163
He's just mad
about his mock exam results.

7
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:25,466
He can't eat after going from first
to the fifth rank in the province.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,059
See you later!
Hey, Park Jong Hoon! Wait for me!

9
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,905
If you don't come to eat,

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,598
I'm going to pack it up for you
and barge into the library!

11
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,853
I'm home!

12
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:58,022
I'll do it. Go in and rest.

13
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,900
No, you should rest and then study.

14
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:02,594
Cooking is my study, now.

15
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,772
Don't worry and go ahead in.

16
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:06,197
Okay!

17
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:42,200
You said mackerel pike is best
when cooked over a briquette fire.

18
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:45,603
I also said it's a nostalgic food
for older people.

19
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,771
It's nostalgic for me too.

20
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:51,952
I don't think I can ever
forget the taste...

21
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,856
of the mackerel pike I had
on my first day here.

22
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:57,849
That's already
more than ten years ago.

23
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:06,200
Good work today, everyone.

24
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,224
It's not much,
but I hope you enjoy the meal.

25
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,010
You should show up to school...

26
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:17,845
as often as you show up
to the diner.

27
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:19,504
He skipped school today again?

28
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,272
I was on my way to school,

29
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,551
but then something important
came up.

30
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:26,678
You think you get to skip school
when something comes up?

31
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,522
It's not like I'm going to college.

32
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:31,449
Why do I need to have
perfect attendance?

33
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,318
Even if you're
not the best student,

34
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,629
I just wanted you
to grow up to be strong.

35
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,890
You really did grow up only strong.

36
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:43,561
Take your time.
Why are you rushing so much?

37
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,622
Even ten minutes is a waste for me.

38
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,339
Young Shin, I ate as you said.

39
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,208
Don't embarrass me by bringing me
a plate at the library.

40
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,762
Thank you for the meal.

41
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,390
Jung Hoon is the only one...

42
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:04,989
who seems like a high school senior.

43
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:11,155
His face looks so
thin from studying.

44
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,476
He said he'll go to medical school
even if he dies trying.

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,607
Medical school?

46
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,146
Do you think you can get into med
school just with good grades?

47
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:30,275
You should study engineering.
You can even get a scholarship.

48
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,076
If I can't get into med school,

49
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,989
I'm going to quit everything
and just get a job.

50
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,224
What? Then how am I supposed
to have fun at college by myself?

51
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,051
Did you even talk to your dad?

52
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,238
I'm probably the only mother...

53
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,008
who gives her senior daughter
a face mask.

54
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,800
When you're done with this,
get to studying.

55
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:02,716
Aren't you so happy Jung Hoon
is going to medical school?

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,119
Are you feeling rushed and trying
to make me all pretty?

57
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,787
Who do you think I am?

58
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,256
Anyway, which college
are you going to?

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,624
Is there anywhere you have in mind?

60
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:13,060
I don't need
to have anywhere in mind.

61
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,888
Based on where Jung Hoon goes,
whichever major it is,

62
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:18,888
I'm going to go to the same school.

63
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,592
How could you say that?

64
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,457
I'm scared someone might hear you.

65
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:27,498
I have a cooking certificate,
so I'll work after graduating.

66
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,510
If you're worried about tuition,
don't be.

67
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,004
I have a college savings fund
for you.

68
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,640
When I decided to raise you,

69
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,867
I wanted to make sure you
at least...

70
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:40,578
could study like other kids.

71
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:44,549
I'm so happy even like this.

72
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,697
You should've let him send you
to college.

73
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:52,532
Why are you so confident
with not going?

74
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,992
How much do you think he makes...

75
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,689
selling food for four dollars?

76
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,831
Diner and the house we live in...

77
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,267
are both rentals.

78
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:04,369
How could I spend
his hard-earned money on tuition?

79
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:07,165
Then why did you study so hard?

80
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,400
I wanted to beat you. So what?

81
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,475
What?

82
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:17,290
You know how much
Mr. Jung sacrificed...

83
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:19,079
for me.

84
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:24,447
I really want to show him
that I can be happy...

85
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,189
even if I don't go to college.

86
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,181
I mean it!

87
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,080
What brings you here so late?

88
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:50,657
Well,

89
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,718
Jung Hoon is staying up
all night studying,

90
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:55,896
and I was wondering...

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
if you make food for other students.

92
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,892
Oh, that's why you're here?

93
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,477
What would he like?

94
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:04,103
Oh, right, Mr. Park.

95
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:07,398
Did you hear that he wants to go
to medical school?

96
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,333
Medical school?

97
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,801
I heard you want
to go to medical school.

98
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,073
You should study engineering.
I can afford that.

99
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,713
I'm not going to study engineering.

100
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,433
I don't want to live like you.

101
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,478
What?

102
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,119
I can't afford medical
school tuition!

103
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,343
Mom said she'll pay.

104
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:32,557
You're in contact with your mother?

105
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,434
I contacted her first this time.

106
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,827
Did you contacted her...

107
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,906
to ask for tuition money?

108
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,833
Get up!

109
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,265
Get up and look at my face!

110
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,313
Mom is responsible for me too!

111
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,582
What money does your mother have...

112
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,606
to send you to medical school?

113
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:52,976
She said she has it.

114
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:55,929
Do you think that's her money?

115
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,658
It's that jerk's money!

116
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,150
He's her husband!

117
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,983
You...

118
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,804
don't know why I divorced
your mother, do you?

119
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:05,986
I know.

120
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,389
I know, and I knew a long time ago.

121
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,004
You got divorced because she cheated
on you with that man.

122
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:14,041
I can't believe you know about it
and you still want...

123
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,009
to go to college with his money!

124
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,733
I don't care whose money it is.

125
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,616
I don't even care
if it's stolen money!

126
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:22,507
I'm going to medical school...

127
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,252
and leaving this tiny town!

128
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,015
- You can't. I won't let you.
- Yes, I can.

129
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:30,194
Am I your property?

130
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,126
That day that Mom said
she'd take me,

131
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,046
you wanted to take out
your anger on her...

132
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,918
by dragging me
to the middle of nowhere!

133
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,788
Why did you have to drag me here
and ruin my life?

134
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:53,847
Your father asked me
for a snack in case you got hungry,

135
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,374
so I brought mushroom porridge.

136
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,945
Jung Hoon!

137
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:03,881
Park Jung Hoon!

138
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,398
We're closed.

139
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,644
Mr. Park!

140
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:26,404
Do you have any leftovers?

141
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,257
All I need is some kimchi.

142
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,058
Don't worry about anything tonight.

143
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,118
Just have a few drinks
and go to bed.

144
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,256
Although it's a petty life,

145
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,077
I guess I am indeed a foolish man.

146
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,896
I'm not sure if my ego is
hurt or just upset.

147
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,124
But honestly, I can't tell
why I'm in so much pain.

148
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:01,539
Him saying that I dragged him here
to take out my anger...

149
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:05,468
on his mother keeps
lingering in my mind.

150
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:09,345
At the time,
she was crying and begging...

151
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,384
just to take
Jung Hoon and nothing else.

152
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,951
If she said she couldn't take him,

153
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:22,523
I might have sent him anyway
even if he didn't want to.

154
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:36,466
Now that I think about it,

155
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:41,712
I really feel so bad for him...

156
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,779
that it makes me shake.

157
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,240
I only ignored him
because I was sorry.

158
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:53,559
So,

159
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,199
he can't even look me in the eye.

160
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:06,723
But actually,

161
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,597
it was me...

162
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:14,901
who turned away first.

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,086
It'll be dawn soon.

164
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:38,725
You always come here and sit.
Do you want to go somewhere?

165
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:40,808
When I was young,

166
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,433
I couldn't get on the train and sat
here because I didn't have money...

167
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:47,484
to buy a train ticket.

168
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:50,145
Is it because you wanted
to go to your mom?

169
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:53,821
My mom didn't even care about me,

170
00:10:55,826 --> 00:11:01,062
and my dad neglected me
because of his pains.

171
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:04,499
I hated them both.

172
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,567
Jung Hoon.

173
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,737
I thought the only way was to study.

174
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:13,675
Everyone knows
how hard you studied.

175
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,843
I will go to med school.

176
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,447
When I become a doctor,

177
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,999
I will leave this town...

178
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,086
with just one person.

179
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,700
Who is that?

180
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:29,290
- Is it your dad?
- Are you out of your mind?

181
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,593
Then, is it Da Jung?

182
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:37,441
Hey! If you leave with her,
what about her parents?

183
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,283
Take her parents with you
if you must leave.

184
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,307
Stop talking nonsense.

185
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,576
I wanted to grab any train
and leave,

186
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,945
but I couldn't leave
because of that person...

187
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:55,283
and I've been holding on until now.

188
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:10,707
- Why couldn't you sleep until dawn?
- I was talking with Jung Hoon.

189
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,377
What did you talk about
until dawn in the library?

190
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,861
Don't ask anymore!

191
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,637
I won't tell you anyway.

192
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:18,815
It's a better world now.

193
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:22,443
Young Shin and Jung Hoon talk
about secrets without me knowing.

194
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,460
Hey. This is bringing back memories.

195
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,500
What's that look for?

196
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,321
Are you worried about something?

197
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,425
I don't have any secrets from you.

198
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,104
We have no secrets between us.

199
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:44,098
Jung Hoon gave me
a pretty notebook yesterday.

200
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:47,635
But he told me not to tell you.

201
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,681
Why is he like that?

202
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,306
I feel really burdened.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,777
Maybe it's because he wants
to get along with you.

204
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,212
Oh Bok!

205
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:04,819
You're popular
because you're pretty and kind.

206
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,922
I'm too popular. Seriously.

207
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,358
Let's go.

208
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:20,149
What are you doing here
and not going home?

209
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:22,513
I was waiting to go with you.

210
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,139
I'm going to go with Young Shin.

211
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:30,964
Young Shin. I have something
to say to Da Jung.

212
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,655
Can you go first?

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,881
Well, okay.

214
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,525
You two talk. I'll go first.

215
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:42,766
Hey. What do you
and I have so much to talk about?

216
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,235
Hear what he has to say.

217
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,259
See you later at the Diner!

218
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,633
My dad gave me an allowance.

219
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,567
- Let's get tteokbokki!
- Gosh.

220
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:00,141
How come you're so stingy?

221
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,845
It would be nice
if Young Shin eats with us.

222
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:08,106
It's because I want to eat with you.

223
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,717
You eat as much as you want!

224
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:11,835
Young Shin! Wait for me!

225
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,087
Da Jung.

226
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,313
Jun Young, is college fun?

227
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,290
Uncle Jong Gwon! Please buy me
a studio in front of the school!

228
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,069
Not a chance.

229
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,745
What are you trying to do
while you live out?

230
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:32,173
As he's a boy, it's not bad for him
to live independently early.

231
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,386
It's not good to keep your children
in your arms.

232
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,023
At least give him a chance
to learn how to live in the world.

233
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,017
How can you say that
in this day and age?

234
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,322
I'd probably blow his brains out...

235
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:46,996
while trying to teach him
about the world.

236
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,298
Well,

237
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,995
what would I know when I haven't
even raised children before?

238
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,548
I almost forgot.
Let's meet tonight, everyone.

239
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:55,229
I have something to discuss.

240
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,106
I have other companies...

241
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,763
so I'm thinking of removing
my name from the Royal Palace.

242
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:04,839
What do you guys think?

243
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:10,678
Do you mean you're withdrawing
from the CEO position?

244
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,259
Do you want to try?

245
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:14,840
Me?

246
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:16,865
How can I?

247
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,522
Or Jong Woo, you try it.

248
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,501
Jong Gwon.

249
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,407
It's time for both of you
to become bosses.

250
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:43,729
You should do this.

251
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,123
I can't do it
as I can't concentrate.

252
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,416
Finally, the moment has come.

253
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:56,066
If she becomes the CEO,
we will gain nothing.

254
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,485
If we get pushed back here,
we're done.

255
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:01,229
Do as I say.

256
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:07,704
Jun Young will take over
the restaurant later.

257
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:11,190
Wouldn't it be better for me
to teach Jun Young the work...

258
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,774
and manage the restaurant?

259
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,690
- I'm not sure.
- From Sook Jung's point of view,

260
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,353
it'll be awkward for her...

261
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,450
to train Jun Young harshly
as he's not even her child.

262
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:24,573
It sure is.

263
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,655
Let's think about it.

264
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,431
You're so gentle.

265
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,769
It'll be difficult to have the staff
under your control.

266
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:39,367
What if you get offended?

267
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,792
In terms of being gentle,
there is no one...

268
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:47,008
more gentle than Jong Woo and you.

269
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,361
You only cooked
so you're ignorant of the world.

270
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,660
Well, Sook Jung really doesn't
know anything but cooking.

271
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,532
She's so gentle and innocent.

272
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,495
Then let's do this.

273
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,811
As we have to think
about Jun Young too,

274
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:06,160
you be in charge,
and then hand it over to Jun Young.

275
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:08,329
Thank you, Jong Gwon!

276
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,097
It's better to do that, right?

277
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,836
Take your time and decide.

278
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:18,875
What more time does he need?

279
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,136
Jun Young is the only descendant
of this family.

280
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,596
I'm saying this...

281
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,603
as we can't ruin the restaurant
before handing it over to him.

282
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,951
You don't want to hand over
the restaurant in shreds.

283
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,430
Why would the restaurant be
in shreds?

284
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,060
What the heck does she mean that...

285
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,636
the restaurant is going to foreclose
as we have tax delinquencies?

286
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,839
We have some tax delinquencies.

287
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:45,032
Where is the money to pay this tax?

288
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,713
I did something.

289
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:48,750
"Did something"?

290
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:50,299
You're out of your mind, honey!

291
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:53,600
Don't worry. I'll get the money...

292
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,551
- and pay it back.
- Where from?

293
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,598
How can you get a hold
of such a large amount of money?

294
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,090
If so, you should have told me!

295
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,383
That way, I would've found a way!

296
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:03,744
I was scared.

297
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,130
See? Even now,
you never let up on me.

298
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,231
What? You were scared?

299
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,325
Am I scary?
Sook Jung is the scary one.

300
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,637
I'm scared of you more.

301
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:16,818
Goodness. It's unbelievable!

302
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,499
And at a crucial moment!

303
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,468
My blood pressure is going up.

304
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,610
Are you going to the private class?

305
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,715
Did you ask Young Shin
what the side dishes are for dinner?

306
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,003
Oh Bok.

307
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,473
You don't even come to school.
What are you doing there?

308
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:42,723
Mind your own business.

309
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,496
Do you really want
to live like that?

310
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,545
Are you worried about me?

311
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,303
I'm looking down on you.

312
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,242
How dare you say that?

313
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,153
If you meet me in town from now on,
just ignore me, all right?

314
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,714
- This is a warning.
- Why?

315
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:09,275
Are you embarrassed
because I pretend to know you?

316
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,718
Didn't you know?

317
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,409
Darn it!

318
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,331
Young Shin!

319
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,905
- This is serious!
- What's wrong?

320
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:34,405
Oh Bok got into a fight
with gangsters at the crossroads.

321
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:35,437
What?

322
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,650
- Go quickly and get Yong Goo!
- Right.

323
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,044
Shall we call the police?

324
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:46,192
Then what if Oh Bok
gets expelled from school?

325
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:49,108
- He's still a student!
- That's right!

326
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,103
Hey!

327
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,791
All of you, stop it right now!

328
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,376
I called the police!

329
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,176
Do you all want to get arrested?

330
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,638
Stop it at once!

331
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,313
Stop hitting him, you punk!

332
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:21,697
Hey, Oh Bok.

333
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:23,986
What is this brat?

334
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,776
This brat is Kim Young Shin.

335
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,325
Haven't you heard
of Kim Young Shin of Diner?

336
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:33,676
We have the chief of police...

337
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,409
and pastor as our regulars!

338
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,143
So go ahead and hit me!

339
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,743
Once you hit me,

340
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:42,409
you won't be able to
live normally in this town!

341
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,250
Come on, hit me!

342
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,209
Stop it right now, you punks!

343
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,267
Young Shin.

344
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,900
- Oh Bok.
- Why this little...

345
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,752
Oh Bok!

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,054
No, Oh Bok.

347
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,034
Police officer!

348
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,401
Sir, here!

349
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,209
Goodness, my babies!

350
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,943
- What has happened?
- Are you hurt, Young Shin?

351
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:23,209
- My dear!
- Do you recognize me, Oh Bok?

352
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,600
My goodness, Oh Bok.

353
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,147
So this is how it ends up.

354
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:32,340
Look at me, Oh Bok.

355
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,358
Are you okay?

356
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,309
Young Shin! Wake up!

357
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,409
My gosh, Young Shin!

358
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:46,209
Open your eyes!

359
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,176
We need to call 911!

360
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,005
Wake up, Oh Bok.

361
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,158
Come on, carry him already.
Goodness.

362
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:55,554
Stay with me, Oh Bok.

363
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,213
Oh Bok, for goodness' sake.

364
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:02,478
Which way is the hospital?

365
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,342
Is it this way? Or that way?

366
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,643
It's this way!

367
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,543
There's nothing to be confused.
You just have to follow them!

368
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,143
You idiot.

369
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,100
Hurry up! Oh Bok, my poor baby.

370
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:16,865
Young Shin, please wake up.

371
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,602
Oh, dear.

372
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,671
Young Shin.

373
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:38,787
Are you okay, Young Shin?

374
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,623
I was just startled a bit.

375
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,663
Why would you meddle in boys' fight?

376
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,634
Mr. Jung is furious for real.

377
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,772
What if one of them hit you?

378
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:59,908
You could've been
seriously dangerous.

379
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:03,478
I was too frantic
to think reasonably.

380
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,049
You won't be able to see me...

381
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:09,709
if you meddle in Oh Bok's fight.

382
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,254
Is that supposed to be a threat?

383
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,257
How can you be such smug
even in this situation?

384
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:18,460
I did warn you.

385
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,505
I bet he's throwing a tantrum
for wasting his time to study.

386
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,610
He acts so well
as if he really cares about you.

387
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,548
He has no serious injury.

388
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:43,418
He can go home after being treated.

389
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:45,520
Thank you, doctor.

390
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:57,710
My goodness.

391
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:01,303
Gosh, an old lady like me can't
bear this extreme.

392
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,909
Even if I have to search
the whole country,

393
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,643
I'm going to find your parents
and ask them to take you.

394
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:09,854
But you don't know where they are.

395
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,042
You can't search the whole country.

396
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,816
It's already been ten years
since they left him with me...

397
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,073
saying that they would be back
after they make a raise.

398
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:18,401
They won't recognize him
in the streets...

399
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:20,489
even if they run into him.

400
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,054
You should've just let me die.

401
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,598
Why did you carry me
to the hospital?

402
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:28,808
Why do you belittle yourself?

403
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,265
I don't have the looks,

404
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,335
brain, nor money.

405
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,440
I don't even have parents!

406
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:40,837
I'm nothing but a moron...

407
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:43,995
who is too coward
to take his own life.

408
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,743
You should've let them
beat me up to death.

409
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,383
Why did you carry me
to the hospital to save me?

410
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,540
Oh Bok.

411
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:53,388
Oh Bok!

412
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:54,976
Come on.

413
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:09,304
Listen carefully, you.

414
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,874
I won't forgive you
if this happens again.

415
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:15,811
I couldn't just watch
and let him be beaten to death.

416
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:18,712
I had meals with him
at the same table for ten years.

417
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:20,248
If something happens to you,

418
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:23,284
I won't be able to live a life.

419
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,121
Mr. Jung.

420
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,109
What are you doing there?

421
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,875
You should've come in
if you were hungry.

422
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,537
You've made trouble for me.

423
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:03,759
What trouble?

424
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,091
Must I be worried about you
at this important period of my life?

425
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:11,266
It's about time you start
to think of others.

426
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,202
Have some ramyeon while you're here.

427
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:19,074
Young Shin.

428
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:22,055
Yes?

429
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:24,379
Who says I'm here for ramyeon?

430
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,650
Why would you yell at me?

431
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:29,484
If it's such a waste of your time,
go and study.

432
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:32,972
I couldn't read a single word...

433
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:35,121
because of you.
That's why I ended up here.

434
00:26:38,384 --> 00:26:39,418
What?

435
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:45,467
Why can't you read because of me?

436
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,969
You could just let me
be the bad guy here.

437
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,711
Why would I let you be the bad guy?

438
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:53,341
Do you really not understand
what I'm saying?

439
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,279
What do you mean?

440
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:00,449
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

441
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:44,242
(A Good Supper)

442
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,676
You take responsibility for it.

443
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,176
I will so don't worry.

444
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,376
Men won't tell women anything
that'd make them look pathetic.

445
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,743
Seniors don't have time for that.

446
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:55,043
It seems you share quite a lot
with Young Shin.

447
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,609
Be nice to Oh Bok.

448
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,109
But he's a nasty piece of work.

449
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,633
We have someone
who needs his nose fixed.

450
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:03,378
- Get out!
- Uncle!

451
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,577
Fine, you win.

452
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,743
I have to do more
than enough to get them.

453
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,143
I've prepared something.

454
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,332
Now, look. You piece of craps.

455
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,723
I am Choi Sook Jung, the owner
of this great "Royal Palace".

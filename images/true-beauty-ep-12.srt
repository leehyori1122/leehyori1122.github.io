00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,667
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:25,318
(Lee Joo Hun confesses the truth behind Jeong Se Yeon's death)

3
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,498
Soo Ho.

4
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,308
It's you again.

5
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:55,608
Yes.

6
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:04,418
It's me again.

7
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,418
I wanted to see you,

8
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:12,597
and here you are.

9
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:17,168
I came to give you a hug.

10
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:42,347
Do you feel better?

11
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,287
I don't have a lot of memories with my dad.

12
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:48,727
After my mom passed away,

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,828
he was mostly in the States.

14
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,828
I lived with my grandmother,

15
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,137
and I started living alone once I entered middle school.

16
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,238
It must've been tough.

17
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,477
I hated him for a long time.

18
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,218
I had a lot of pent up anger toward him,

19
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,447
and I finally let it out.

20
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,257
I thought that would make me feel better.

21
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,058
But I still feel uneasy.

22
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,778
I don't know if it's because I still can't forgive him...

23
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,678
or if it's because I feel bad for him now.

24
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,078
I'm still not sure...

25
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,018
what it is that I'm feeling right now.

26
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,977
What? You just ran out in the middle of your lesson?

27
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,708
Honey, calm down. Just talk it out with her.

28
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,507
Where is your mind at?

29
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:21,218
Don't you know that this is an important period for you?

30
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,148
How dare you?

31
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,018
Don't you dare glare at me like that!

32
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,557
- That little... - Honey, wait.

33
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:34,758
Honey, please. Calm down.

34
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,237
What do you think you're doing? Open the door right now!

35
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:44,008
Honey, I'll talk to her, so please stop.

36
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,208
Open the door!

37
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:14,838
Mr. Kang, how are things at the office?

38
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,167
It's a complete mess.

39
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,737
The reporters and Black Soul fans are in front of the building.

40
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,537
And it's caused serious damage to the agency.

41
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,708
Your father probably has a lot on his mind too.

42
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:48,737
("Missing You")

43
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:31,847
(Dear Soo Ho and Seo Jun)

44
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:34,078
(I wasn't going to write this because it felt so corny.)

45
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,117
Hey.

46
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,847
(Congratulations on winning first place, Se Yeon!)

47
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:38,388
Here.

48
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:42,188
Gosh, it's loose.

49
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,727
- You're wearing the hat crooked. - Wear this.

50
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,797
Dear Soo Ho and Seo Jun.

51
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,268
- How do I look? - It looks nice on you.

52
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:59,037
I wasn't going to write this because it felt so corny.

53
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,547
I wasn't able to thank you guys when I won the first place...

54
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,347
because I was busy crying.

55
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:05,747
(Congratulations on winning first place, Se Yeon!)

56
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:07,718
I'm writing a letter hoping you guys won't feel upset.

57
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:15,357
I always had a lonely life,

58
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:17,458
but thanks to you guys,

59
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,057
the past three years of my life were filled with warmth.

60
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,938
Thanks to our time together, I was able to laugh a lot,

61
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:28,737
gain more confidence,

62
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,537
and finally achieve my dream.

63
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,188
Today's the best day of my entire life.

64
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:49,057
And I will always remember...

65
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,787
you guys were with me today.

66
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,128
My precious friends.

67
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:01,297
I love you guys.

68
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:07,307
I know I'll feel embarrassed if you guys read this letter,

69
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:10,278
so I hope you never find it.

70
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:12,948
From Se Yeon.

71
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,568
Do you know what Se Yeon said the day we bought this?

72
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,107
He hoped that our friendship would last forever.

73
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:38,737
I told him to stop being so childish.

74
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,208
Yes, you did.

75
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,048
Back then, I took it for granted.

76
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,418
So I thought we'd always be together forever.

77
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,357
But who knew he'd die so quickly?

78
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,227
I know.

79
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:58,487
It really didn't last long.

80
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:01,298
I wasn't there for him when he was having a hard time.

81
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,468
And I regret it so much.

82
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,397
But he's no longer around.

83
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,637
So I ended up taking it out on you...

84
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:14,977
because it made me feel better.

85
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:19,277
I was so caught up with how hurt I was...

86
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:21,617
that I didn't know that you were hurting inside as well.

87
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:26,357
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,397
What's the matter with us?

89
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,178
(Missed call, Dad)

90
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,678
How's your dad handling this?

91
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,347
I don't know.

92
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,487
In the past, I was so jealous of you for having a rich dad.

93
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,458
But now I'm not jealous at all.

94
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:03,387
Why were you jealous?

95
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,027
You have a mom.

96
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:06,857
Are you trying to compete with who has a sadder life?

97
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:09,668
Your family's rich.

98
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:11,928
I'm not sure that's true anymore.

99
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,538
Rich people don't have problems eating three meals a day...

100
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,568
even if they go bankrupt.

101
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:16,708
You mean they're okay for three generations.

102
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:18,938
- You idiot. - What?

103
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:20,977
You really know nothing.

104
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,948
Gosh, who threw this cigarette bud?

105
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,647
Are you talking to me?

106
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:34,188
Did you just throw this cigarette bud at us?

107
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,828
What kind of a gangster are you?

108
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,857
Look at this kid. He just called us gangsters.

109
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,198
- Who is this kid? - Who?

110
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,928
- Look at those kids. - Who are you boys?

111
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,298
What's your problem?

112
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,767
What's your deal?

113
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,737
Hey, kid. Come over here.

114
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:49,668
Look at him.

115
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,708
Just hold your anger.

116
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,007
Hey. Run.

117
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:55,607
Hey.

118
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,948
- Hey... Hey. - Catch them.

119
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,277
- Come over here. - Hey!

120
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:02,347
- Hey! Get over here! - Where do you think you're going?

121
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:04,448
- Catch them. - Are you going to throw that?

122
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:07,418
What do you think you're doing?

123
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,527
Catch them!

124
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,987
- Go! - Get over here!

125
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,897
- Hey! - Come here!

126
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,397
- Get over here! - Go get them!

127
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,968
- Hey, come here! - Run!

128
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,168
Catch them!

129
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:21,097
- Get back here! - Go get them!

130
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:23,908
Catch them!

131
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,377
- Run! - Catch them!

132
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,877
- Run faster! - Go get them!

133
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,918
Hey!

134
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,247
My gosh.

135
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,188
- My gosh. - Darn it.

136
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,857
My gosh, what's this smell?

137
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,527
- Darn it. - Come out here.

138
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,328
- What's this smell? - They jumped into a pile of feces.

139
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,328
What did they use to fertilize this place?

140
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,298
Consider yourselves lucky.

141
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,468
- Let's go. - Okay, boss.

142
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,538
- My gosh. - Seriously.

143
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:00,877
You and your temper!

144
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,178
I didn't know!

145
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,048
Hey. I carried you.

146
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:06,918
My arm hurts.

147
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,647
It stinks.

148
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:11,548
Get off of me.

149
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,267
Ju Kyung should see you now.

150
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,568
Because she'd be disappointed?

151
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:30,107
Do you think that would make her go to you?

152
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,637
I never said that. Do I make you nervous?

153
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:34,808
Obviously.

154
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,308
Are you over her yet or not?

155
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:37,808
It's not that easy.

156
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,078
Then what? Do you plan to tell your feelings for her?

157
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,487
Are you stupid? She's going out with you.

158
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:45,147
Get over it.

159
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,458
- It's not that easy. - Then what do you plan to do?

160
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,828
I don't know. Get away from me.

161
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,928
- Don't touch me. - I didn't.

162
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,568
You have poop all over your face. You reek.

163
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,767
Look who's talking.

164
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,637
(Period Makeup)

165
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,578
Are you finally registering?

166
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,908
Yes. I got paid today.

167
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,347
Will you be the next Selena?

168
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,418
(Will you be the next Selena?)

169
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:48,918
Hello.

170
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,487
I came to register.

171
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,387
Okay. Please fill this out.

172

173
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,568
Stop spilling.

174
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:18,178
- Should I add rice? - Yes.

175
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,127
Thanks. Get me some water.

176
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:40,968
It's mine.

177
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,168
Don't show off that you're dating.

178
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,237
Did you two make up?

179
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,877
I said to stay out of it.

180
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:53,117
How can I?

181
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,847
Didn't you fight because of the rumor that she and I are dating?

182
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,288
You petty loser.

183
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:01,517
There must be a reason why she can't tell the others...

184
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,188
that you two are dating.

185
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,357
Like what?

186
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,798
I think it's because of Soo Jin.

187
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,497
Soo Jin?

188
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,038
How are you in a relationship when you're this dense?

189
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,137
You've been on my mind these days.

190
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,777
(Girlfriend)

191
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,887
Hi...

192
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:43,298
Don't laugh. How did it go today?

193
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,968
It almost went well.

194
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,137
The ending was quite the spectacle.

195
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,568
Why? What happened?

196
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:50,968
We rolled on a field of poop.

197
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,838
I didn't know you could make jokes.

198
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,678
How's your leg? Wasn't it tiring walking with a crutch?

199
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,808
You should take it easy.

200
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:02,418
I read that bananas, spinach, safflower, broccoli, and oranges...

201
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,617
are good for healing broken bones.

202
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,387
Remember that.

203
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,257
Bananas, spinach, safflower...

204
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:10,288
Why are you laughing?

205
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:12,857
I like hearing you nag. Keep going.

206
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,527
Stop that.

207
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,828
That's right. I have something for you.

208
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,497
What is it?

209
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,068
Hold on.

210
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:23,838
Where is it?

211
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:25,208
Ta-da!

212
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,637
Don't you have anything for me?

213
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:30,877
Me?

214
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,647
Ta-da!

215
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,017
Here's another one.

216
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,688
- Ju Kyung! - I said to knock.

217
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,658
- Take this. - What?

218
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:53,438
Gross.

219
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:56,908
I'm going to kill you! I'll kill you!

220
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:02,408
Hey.

221
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,277
Good night. I'll call you tomorrow.

222
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:12,517
Gross!

223
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:33,507
What's this? Hey, Seo Jun. Open this door.

224
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,378
Hey! Hey!

225
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,777
Seo Jun!

226
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,928
I finally get to see you. See you at school.

227
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:55,257
Come home early, will you? You're just like your dad.

228
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,598
- See you later. - That brat.

229
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:04,438
- I'm here. - Already?

230
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,317
You must've left home early.

231
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:18,648
You should've gone straight to school.

232
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,257
We have to hide it at school though.

233
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,087
Let's walk like this to the bus stop.

234
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:27,227
Are you okay with it? You wanted to tell the others.

235
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:30,468
I was blinded by jealousy, that was why.

236
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,468
Jealousy?

237
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,968
Why were you jealous?

238
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,868
Let's tell them once you're comfortable with it.

239
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,837
- Did Soo Jin... - What?

240
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,108
Never mind.

241
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:49,517
Hey.

242
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,648
Your zipper was open.

243
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,918
Thanks.

244
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:57,928
You transferred, right? I saw you in the teachers' office.

245
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,658
Yes.

246
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:03,468

247
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:05,698

Lim Ju Kyung?

250
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,287
Let's go, Soo Jin.

251
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:07,366
Why is Hye Min here?

252
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,106
That was our uniform.

253
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,366
Did she transfer here? Why?

254
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,537
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

255
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:18,406
What? No, I'm fine.

256
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:24,146
Soo Ho! Is your dad retiring?

257
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:26,716
What's up, my friend? Congratulations on your recovery.

258
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,616
Applause. Applause.

259
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:30,727
Congratulations for what?

260
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:35,926
Soo Ho.

261
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:38,626
Did you lose the cast?

262
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,797
- What about it? - I did.

263
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,497
Are they going to fight?

264
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,936
Good.

265
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:47,436
Are you sleeping already?

266
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:51,277
- Yes. - What's with this lukewarm mood?

267
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,547
It's good, but...

268
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,876
You should get along with your friends.

269
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:58,317
Ju Kyung! You're here. Check this out.

270
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:01,087
I entered you in the Newstagram Queen Contest...

271
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,327
and you're in second place.

272
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:06,156
You're not trailing far behind, so you might take the lead.

273
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,727
Oh, I see.

274
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:08,956
What does the winner get?

275
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:10,426
- Prize money? - No.

276
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,896
It just feels good to win.

277
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,196
The leader of a girl group that recently debuted...

278
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:17,666
was sought out by entertainment agencies...

279
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,206
after winning first place.

280
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:21,676
What's so good about getting that famous though?

281
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:25,646
Well, being famous just feels good.

282
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:28,047
Not for me though.

283
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,386
The schools' pride is on the line,

284
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,916
so everyone's trying to make one from their school win.

285
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,686
I was eliminated from the race earlier on,

286
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:39,227
but you should win and maintain our dignity.

287
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:42,126
Annoyingly enough, the one currently in first place goes to Yongpa High.

Did you doubt me?

295
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:06,787
Didn't you force everyone to vote for you?

296
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:07,856
Exactly.

297
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:16,797
Why did you upload my photo? Please pull it down.

298
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:19,666
The voting has begun, so I can't.

Guys, log onto Newstagram...

00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,406
and vote for Ju Kyung. Come on.

00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:03,446
Did you have something to say?

00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:04,577
Nothing.

309
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:08,176
I see that Ju Kyung got an A plus.

310
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:10,987
- Sorry? - That's a good grade.

311
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,186
A plus.

312
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:17,686
Is there a reason why she can't get an A plus?

313
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:20,057
Her choice to write about horror fiction was fresh...

314
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,997
and she logically criticized...

315
00:23:21,997 --> 00:23:24,327
the prejudice that divides different genres.

316
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,997
Her score was based accurately on the score guidelines.

317
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:29,037
I wasn't showing favoritism.

318
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,606
The fact that you have to explain yourself like a loser...

319
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,977
makes it seem more like a pathetic excuse.

320
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,646
Now I'm really suspicious.

321
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:39,307
Explaining myself like a loser?

322
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,477
Me? When did I ever?

323
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:44,747
Sorry about that.

That's great. I was worried, you know.

328
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:11,847
So what are you doing after school? Could we talk?

Well, this doesn't seem like the right place.

Is it important? Can't you cancel it?

This is something I can only tell you about.

334

00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:35,636
Oh, I never told you, did I?

337
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,837
It's Ju Kyung. She's my girlfriend.

338
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,376
For some reason, she doesn't want to tell the others yet,

339
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:45,807
so play dumb for a while.

340
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:49,477
Why did you just tell me though?

341
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:51,116
I thought you should know...

342
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:53,916
because you're my friend.

343
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,247
But everyone will see us.

344
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:25,946
I'll then do this.

345
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:28,186
What?

346
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:30,856
Soo Ho's leg must still hurt.

347
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:32,656
- I hope you get well soon. - Thanks.

348
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,057
- Darn, he's tall. - Get well soon.

349
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,396
See?

350
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,597
Is something up though? You seem worried.

351
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,436
It's nothing. Come on.

352
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,136
Soo Jin saved us seats.

353
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:48,277
There she is.

354
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,247
- Enjoy. - Enjoy your lunch.

355
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,646
- Hey. - You're here.

356
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:54,616
- Hi, guys. - I'm starving.

357
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:02,916
Soo Jin, who's she?

358
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:04,987
Oh, this is Hye Min.

359
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:07,656
We have a class together, so I invited her to join us.

360
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,257
I see. Hi!

361
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,527
- Hi. - Hi.

362
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:13,636
You don't seem familiar though. Did you transfer?

363
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:14,866
From which school?

364
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,606
Yongpa High School.

365
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,737
Is that so?

366
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:21,477
What? Another student from Yongpa High?

367
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:23,406
Ju Kyung, the bullies that dragged you away...

368
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:25,307
were from that school too.

369
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,446
Unbelievable.

370
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:29,247
Ju Kyung, you transferred schools as well, right?

371
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:30,747
From which one?

372
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,686
- Wait. Did you never tell us? - You're right.

373
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:37,757
I don't think I caught that either.

374
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:39,186
Which school did you transfer from?

375
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:40,956
Well...

376
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:44,666
My old school's quite far away from here.

377
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:47,666
Hey.

378
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,436
Don't you know me?

379
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:57,376
There was a girl named Lim Ju Kyung at my old school.

380
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:00,416
You look a lot like her.

381
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:04,517
Really?

382
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,317
Did you transfer here from Yongpa High?

383
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:09,216
No.

384
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,327
I don't know you.

385
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,597
I don't care how much we look alike.

386
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:16,926
I'm not from Yongpa High, so don't be mistaken.

387
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,497
Oh, I see.

388
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:22,537
Sorry.

389
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,537
There's no need to be that harsh.

390
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,376
Excuse me. My stomach's acting up.

391
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,247
- Hey. - Ju Kyung?

392
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:35,616
She must be really sick.

393
00:27:44,856 --> 00:27:47,156
Do you not really know or are you just playing dumb?

394
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,936
Can makeup really mask people...

395
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:57,567
to the point that they're unrecognizable?

396
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:59,106
What?

397
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:06,577
(Prince Comics)

398
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:08,376
She probably didn't recognize me.

399
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,716
I'm so glad we're not in the same class.

400
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:16,017
No one will find out unless I interact with her.

401
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:21,027
Darn it!

402
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:24,997
What's the matter?

403
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:29,537
Oh, it's nothing.

404
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:38,047
Here. This is for you.

405
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,787
It's only visible to those that are kind.

406
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,347
Can't you see the watch in there?

407
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:46,517
It's expensive, you know.

408
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:50,186
Here. Let me.

409
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,696
If you find yourself out of breath again,

410
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:55,156
take this to your mouth...

411
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:57,097
and breathe in and out.

412
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:59,666
Breathing into this bag will calm you down.

413
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:01,297
Have it with you at all times.

414
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:05,966
Is there more?

415
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:08,106
These are worry dolls.

416
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:10,777
Tell them what's on your mind if you can't sleep.

417
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:13,946
Anything that's making you sad and worried.

418
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,847
Place them under your pillow...

419
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,847
and they'll take away all your worries while you sleep.

420
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,916
I doubt that's true.

421
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:23,416
These are actually used in therapy, you know.

422
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,727
I looked it up.

423
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,866
Knitting helps ease the mind.

424
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:36,936
- Knitting? - Yes.

425
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,337
Lastly.

426
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:41,777
Ta-da!

427
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,247
I bought these with the money I earned.

428
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:45,747
They're a matching set.

429
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:46,946
Open yours.

430
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,446
Cute, right?

431
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:58,327
Kids will figure it out if we hang these on our bags.

432
00:29:58,386 --> 00:29:59,656
I know.

433
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:03,027
So we'll do so when we're able to go public...

434
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,366
with our relationship.

435
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,797
I'm to keep it unused then.

436
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,997
Just having it brings you joy.

437
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,206
So...

438
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:21,716
have you talked to your father since that day?

439
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,587
No.

440
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,317
It may not be easy right now,

441
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:33,356
but I think it'll be nice to talk it out.

442
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,866
I don't want you to regret anything.

443
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:42,597
Got it.

444
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:45,807
These worry dolls though.

445
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,136
Don't you need them more?

446
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:49,636
You worry all the time.

447
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,477
No, these are yours.

448
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,176
They're really cute.

449
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:57,517
They're cute, right?

450
00:30:59,347 --> 00:31:00,686
They have different facial expressions.

454
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:13,027
Ju Kyung deserves to win.

455
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:19,966
Where is it?

456
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,176
What are you looking for?

457
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:25,547
My hoodie. I wonder if Mom put it in here.

458
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:28,817
What's the matter?

459
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,487
- Are you okay? - My gosh.

460
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,716
Gosh, it stinks. Why didn't you throw this away?

Seo Jun.

463
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:43,196
This used to be my right arm. I can't just throw it away.

464
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:45,727
Even so, why would you keep it inside your closet?

465
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,037
It's a nice memory.

466
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:50,037
Later on, when I look back, it'll remind me of what happened.

467
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:53,466
I'll reminisce on what a turbulent life I had.

468
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:54,777
How can I just throw it away?

469
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:57,277
You're crazy. You really are.

470
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,106
Gosh, my toes hurt so much.

471
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,416
Are you okay?

472
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,716
She's right.

473
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,057
Let's throw it away.

- What? - Ju Kyung.

487
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:33,267
You beat that girl from Yongpa High School...

488
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,336
and came in first place!

489
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:38,767
Why? Why did I come in first place?

490
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:43,977
Why don't you tell us how it feels to have caused...

a sensation on social media?

I'm just honored to be a candidate for number one.

- What? - What is this?

495
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,997
- Gosh, you came in second place. - What?

496
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,727
Darn it. Who came in first place?

497
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,366
That hurt.

498
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,937
Ju Kyung, what if you become a celebrity?

499
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:16,537
- She's right. - Not everyone can be a celebrity.

500
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,776
Soo Ah, you drive me crazy.

501

00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,287
- I want to be her stylist. - That's perfect!

504
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,986
- This is great. - It'll suit you well.

505
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:35,156
What are you guys doing in front of my class?

506
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:36,756
Get going already.

507
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,537
I asked Soo Ho, but he turned me down.

508
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:42,997
This isn't good. What should we do?

509
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,466
If everyone keeps refusing, who's going to do it?

510
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,506
Exactly.

511
00:35:47,136 --> 00:35:48,776
- Why are you all gathered here? - What's going on?

512
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:50,776
The Newstagram Queen is from our school.

513
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,377
- It's Lim Ju Kyung. - My gosh.

514
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:54,847
- Is she going to be a celebrity? - What?

515
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:56,477
"Newstagram"?

516
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,187
- There's a star in our school? - My goodness.

517
00:35:58,486 --> 00:35:59,486
Who is it?

518
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:01,586
It's her.

519
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,147
How long am I going to keep living like this?

520
00:36:42,397 --> 00:36:43,426
Here.

521
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:49,397
I can't believe you tripped on your own foot.

522
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:53,366
Why? Were you worried because I fell?

523
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:55,336
Did it break your heart?

524
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:58,147
Were you worried sick about me?

525
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,116
Do you like me that much?

526
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:06,486
What?

527
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:09,857
Yes.

528
00:37:11,557 --> 00:37:13,687
Ju Young, you're a smart guy,

529
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,526
so I'm sure you'll understand what I'm about to say.

530
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:20,767
I guess you've finally noticed my charm.

531
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,497
Do you like flies, or do you hate them?

532
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,807
Flies? I don't like them.

533
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:27,807
How would you feel if a fly keeps bothering you...

534
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,006
while you're sleeping?

535
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,747
It'd be really annoying.

536
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:34,616
That's exactly my point.

537
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,347
- What? - So stop bothering me.

538
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:40,917
You're Ju Kyung's little brother, so if you stop being annoying,

539
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:42,486
we can at least be friends.

540
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:49,156
A fly?

541
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:52,866
Are you going to go straight to the academy?

542
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:54,136
Yes.

543
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,566
- Hey. - Hey.

544
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,707
I'm Park Se Mi from Yongpa High School.

545
00:37:58,767 --> 00:37:59,937
You know me, right?

546
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:07,064
Hey.

547
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,535
Unbelievable.

548
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,564
No, I don't know you.

549
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:16,604
I noticed you won the Newstagram Queen Contest.

550
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:18,345
You managed to beat me.

551
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:23,015
You look better in your photos.

552
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:26,584
But you look way different from the Lim Ju Kyung I know.

553
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:30,285
I see.

554
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:34,524
Why are you in a rush to leave?

555
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:36,894
It feels like you're avoiding me.

556
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:41,535
Why isn't Seo Jun coming out?

557
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,205
I don't know.

558
00:38:44,665 --> 00:38:45,834
Let's go, Soo Jin.

559
00:38:47,774 --> 00:38:49,910
I can't believe she's ignoring me.

560
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:53,104
- Hey, it's Joo Hye Min. - Hye Min!

561
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:55,144
Where are you going?

562
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,274
Hye Min!

563
00:38:58,415 --> 00:38:59,944
Come over here.

564
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:04,185
Smile for me. Smile.

565
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:07,185
Let's go.

566
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:15,894
Hey, who told you to ignore my calls? Do you have a death wish?

567
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,365
I told you there's nothing going on.

568
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:23,475
There's nothing going on between her and Seo Jun.

569
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:27,174
How can you say that even after looking at this?

570
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:28,845
Are you kidding me?

571
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:31,845
Hey, I want you...

572
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:34,984
to keep an eye on Lim Ju Kyung and find out everything about her.

573
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,785
I want to know if she's flirting with anyone...

574
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:40,685
and if there's anything bad about her personality.

575
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:43,955
That way, I'll be able to split them apart.

576
00:39:45,394 --> 00:39:46,725
Aren't you going to answer her?

577
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:48,935
Hye Min!

578
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:54,305
Were you hitting her?

579
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,504
What are you talking about?

580
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:59,345
We were just having a chat. Why?

581
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:06,845
We're supposed to work on our class project today.

582
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,015
Did you forget?

583
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,685
What?

584
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:13,754
Yes.

585
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:17,424
She's going somewhere with us today.

586
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:24,035
The project is more important.

587
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:26,564
- Let's go. - You're not going anywhere.

588
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:35,745
Hey. Why are you butting in?

589
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:38,915
You're from Yongpa High School, aren't you?

590
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,464
Thank you.

591
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:54,265
I'll go now.

592
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:55,734
Wait.

593
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:59,535
You're Ju Kyung, aren't you?

594
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:05,305
Thanks for helping me.

595
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:09,615
But you got a lot prettier.

596
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,515
- I didn't recognize... - Just because I helped you,

597
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,055
it doesn't mean I forgave you.

598
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,924
I'm sorry for back then.

599
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:27,964
I was afraid they'd bully me too if I didn't do as they said.

600
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:30,635
I was too scared.

601
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,274
I shouldn't have done that to you though.

602
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,944
I'm really sorry.

603
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:42,845
I don't want the others...

604
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,214
to know what I used to look like.

605
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:51,055
So don't act like you know me.

606
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:53,084
I won't.

607
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:55,254
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

608
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:09,205
And...

609
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:13,845
What are you doing?

610
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:15,774
You're knitting?

611
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:17,785
It's supposed to be therapeutic.

612
00:42:18,444 --> 00:42:19,685
Do something. Anything.

613
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,685
- Why did you want to see me? - To ask you something.

614
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:27,055
What did you mean when you said Ju Kyung can't tell the others...

615
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,595
that we're going out because of Soo Jin?

616
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:32,165
Do you know anything about it?

617
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:33,394
Why?

618
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:35,234
Ju Kyung has been acting strange.

619
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:38,165
I think something's up.

620
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:41,135
Why are you asking me about your girlfriend?

621
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:44,274
How is she acting strange?

622
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:48,544
She asked me before...

623
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:51,415
about a friend of a friend.

624
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,385
That a friend of a friend got a boyfriend,

625
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:58,084
but that friend of a friend... So, she likes her boyfriend.

626
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:02,254
So the friend of a friend suddenly said she liked the boyfriend...

627
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:06,325
So the friend of a friend and the friend of a friend's friend...

628
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,035
Forget it if you don't get it.

629
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,604
What about you? Isn't Soo Jin an old friend?

630
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,604
Will you not to anything that I don't like?

631
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:17,774
Can you give up your friends for me?

632
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,604
When did she tell you that?

633
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:21,644
When we made dumplings and clipped each other's...

634
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:23,944
Don't ask.

635
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:25,745
I want to erase it from my memory.

636
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,254
Hey. You dropped a stitch.

637
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:33,484
How can you tell?

638
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,555
I used to knit a long time ago.

639
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,725
You have to undo it and redo it.

640
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:39,794
Really?

641
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:45,905
How?

642
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:49,234
Give it to me.

643
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:53,504
Can't you even do that right?

644
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:56,544
No, no. This isn't it.

645
00:43:59,044 --> 00:44:01,854
Soo Ho! I thought we were friends.

646
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,885
I kept begging you to go to the internet cafe with me,

647
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,055
but you refused.

648
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:06,885
How could you do this to me just because you made up?

649
00:44:07,285 --> 00:44:08,694
How can love... No.

650
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:10,825
How can friendship change?

651
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:12,024
What's his problem?

652
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:13,924
Darn it.

653
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:15,595
- Do you know how to knit? - Yes.

654
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,635
I knitted a scarf for Doo Ah.

655
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:18,865
Were you knitting?

656
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,575
- Put this in. - Put this in.

657
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:23,635
- Loop it. - Loop it.

658
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:24,905
- And... - Seo Jun!

659
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:26,805
How could you?

660
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:30,044
You refused to go singing with me to do this?

661
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:33,385
How could friendship change?

662
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,155
I'm starved.

663
00:44:40,185 --> 00:44:41,495
Sorry for making you wait.

664
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:43,754
- How was your class? - Good.

665
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,165
Why did you come all this way?

666
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:47,394
To go home with you.

667
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:54,165
- Ju Kyung. - Yes?

668
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:58,044
Do you feel good or bad?

669
00:44:58,504 --> 00:44:59,745
Why do you ask?

670
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:03,644
Just because. Do you feel good or bad?

671
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:07,915
Good.

672
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:14,854
Won't you tell me what it is?

673
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:18,225
Actually...

674
00:45:19,424 --> 00:45:21,635
A kid from my old school transferred in.

675
00:45:22,564 --> 00:45:23,635
What?

676
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,234
It wasn't because of Soo Jin?

677
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:29,104
I thought she wouldn't recognize me, but she did.

678
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:31,035
Are you okay?

679
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:33,245
I'm nervous,

680
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,015
but she says she won't tell anyone.

681
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:37,615
You must've been scared.

682
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:40,685
A bit.

683
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:44,455
But I'm really okay now.

684
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:55,535
Aren't you hungry?

685
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,165
Should we get something to eat?

686
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:00,464
What should we get?

687
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:02,535
Something you like.

688
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:12,515
I didn't get prettier.

689
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:18,055
I'm breaking out again.

690
00:46:27,524 --> 00:46:29,135
It's so annoying.

691
00:46:30,394 --> 00:46:32,265
Hee Kyung, do you want to go on a blind date?

692
00:46:32,535 --> 00:46:34,774
The pork trotter restaurant owner's son's friend...

693
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:35,874
I have a boyfriend.

694
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:38,475
- You do? - You do?

695
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,975
Are you lying to avoid going on a blind date?

696
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:43,015
It's true.

697
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:46,544
Oh my gosh. How long has it been? What does he do?

698
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:47,785
Is it good looking? How old is he?

699
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,385
It's a secret. I'll introduce you when I think it's time.

700
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:52,584
Do you have a picture?

701
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:55,055
I can tell what he's like just by looking at his face.

702
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:57,854
I'm dying of curiosity.

703
00:46:57,854 --> 00:46:59,524
What is he like?

704
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,365
- My grapefruit. - Grapefruit?

705
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:07,564
He gets cuter and cuter the more I look at him.

706
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:10,604
His face is fruity.

707
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:13,075
Fruity?

708
00:47:13,174 --> 00:47:14,674
I'm home.

709
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:16,475
Welcome home. Come eat.

710
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:19,944
A fly has no right to eat.

711
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:29,055
Lim Ju Kyung, please come to the auditorium.

712
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,055
Ju Kyung!

713
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:33,424
She looks so pretty.

714
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:36,095
You're doing great, Ju Kyung!

715
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:37,435
You look so pretty!

716
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:40,035
An angel has descended!

717
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:44,334
She is lighting up the stage.

718
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,044
Look at her perfect skin!

719
00:47:47,174 --> 00:47:49,575
How did this happen to me?

720
00:47:50,874 --> 00:47:53,984
- She's the perfect school model. - I know.

721
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:55,155
Hold on.

722
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:58,325
Must I do this?

723
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:02,694
Isn't the student body president or the top student usually the model?

724
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:06,225
Yes. But Ju Kyung, they don't want to do it.

725
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,325
What?

726
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:09,834
But why me of all people...

727
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:10,995
What do you mean?

728
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,035
I hear you're our star.

729
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:17,535
You're the star among stars, so you might as well do it.

730
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:20,004
The face of Saebom!

731
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:25,185
Let's try another pose.

732
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,185
You look so pretty!

733
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:31,825
You look pretty!

734
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:34,754
Do it right. Check your form.

735
00:48:35,555 --> 00:48:39,194
Will we see your face when we go into your homepage?

736
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:43,165
The face of Saebom, Lim Ju Kyung.

737
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:46,705
Stop that. Please. I'm not the face.

738
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:48,575
Can't you do that right?

739
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:51,905
3, 4, 5.

740
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:55,044
Did they make up after being hospitalized together?

741
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:56,944
Is it because they shared each other's pain?

742
00:48:57,245 --> 00:48:58,915
- Seven. - You're pulling too hard.

743
00:48:58,915 --> 00:49:00,185
Do it right.

744
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:01,584
- Do it already. - Fine.

745
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:03,685
- Again. - Darn it.

746
00:49:03,685 --> 00:49:05,584
- One. - Why is it one again?

747
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:08,754
You guys will never finish at this rate.

748
00:49:08,754 --> 00:49:10,055
(From Park Se Mi, You've got a new message.)

749
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:11,865
Who is it?

750
00:49:12,794 --> 00:49:13,924
It's nothing.

751
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:16,394
Don't fool around. Do it right.

752
00:49:16,694 --> 00:49:18,435
What are you doing?

753
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,504
What are you doing? Why are you taking my pictures?

754
00:49:27,104 --> 00:49:28,274
Because you look cool.

755
00:49:30,115 --> 00:49:31,544
Don't you like Soo Ho?

756
00:49:31,984 --> 00:49:33,385
I do. So?

757
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:35,885
Don't you know he's going out with Ju Kyung?

758
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:36,915
I do.

759
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:39,725
You like her although you know. Am I wrong?

760
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:53,935
(- Give me Ju Kyung's pictures. - Then give me Seo Jun's.)

761
00:49:58,444 --> 00:50:00,845
(Park Se Mi)

762
00:50:10,055 --> 00:50:12,484
It's like one would take of a real boyfriend. Thanks.

763
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:15,155
Why do you want her photos though?

764
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,144
Are these all you have?

765
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:34,705
All that running made me hungry.

766
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:35,874
Let's get a snack.

767
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:37,544
What should we have?

768
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:40,015
Ju Kyung!

769
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:42,814
I'm sorry.

770
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:46,825
Are you all right?

771
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:19,254
What's wrong? Are you looking for something?

772
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,955
Gosh, I think I've lost my necklace.

773
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:24,455
Where did I put it? I don't think I took it off.

774
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,365
- The one you have on every day? - Yes.

775
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:28,165
When did you last see it?

776
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:30,135
I definitely had it on this morning.

777
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:32,535
Maybe it got loose during PE.

778
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:35,435
- You think? - Come on. I'll help you.

779
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:36,975
Thanks.

780
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,225
Where did it go?

781
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:00,424
I told her not to look for it.

782
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:02,894
She'll be here all night.

783
00:52:09,174 --> 00:52:10,535
As if it would still be here.

784
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:13,644
Someone probably took it.

785
00:52:13,975 --> 00:52:15,915
It wasn't at Lost and Found.

786
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,915
Besides, I trust the students here.

787
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:19,915
Check out your pride for this school.

788
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,544
Because you're the face of it now?

789
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:22,984
Of course not.

790
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,754
Now move over. You might step on it.

791
00:52:25,825 --> 00:52:27,024
Want some help finding it?

792
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:28,754
What will I get in return?

793
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:31,894
I'll treat you to spicy tteokbokki.

794
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:34,495
Buy something else, will you?

795
00:52:34,924 --> 00:52:37,495
You like it though. Isn't it your favorite?

796
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:40,935
Whatever. If I find it for you, you'll pay me big time.

797
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:42,475
Got it.

798
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,274
Found it!

799
00:52:48,944 --> 00:52:49,944
Really?

800
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:53,084
50 cents. Sweet, isn't it?

801
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,354
Seriously?

802
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,894
I mean it this time. Is this your necklace?

803
00:53:05,064 --> 00:53:06,424
Did you find it?

804
00:53:11,135 --> 00:53:12,435
Just go home already.

805
00:53:12,604 --> 00:53:14,964
Fine. I'll look for it seriously, okay?

806
00:53:14,964 --> 00:53:17,035
I don't appreciate the teasing.

807
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:20,245
Soo Ho gave it to me, so I must find it.

808
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,814
- I'm leaving. - You promised to help me find it.

809
00:53:25,814 --> 00:53:27,115
I'm a busy man.

810
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:29,385
Must you look for this when it's this cold?

811
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:32,984
Is Soo Ho upset because you've lost it?

812
00:53:33,225 --> 00:53:34,354
Of course not.

813
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:39,124
It's special to me which is why I want to find it.

814
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:42,064
Then you should've taken better care of it.

815
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:44,665
I know. How stupid of me.

816
00:53:45,604 --> 00:53:48,135
I won't go home until I find it.

817
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,774
Have fun searching then. Bye.

818
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:01,345
What's this?

819
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,685
Whatever.

820
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,635
Where do I find it?

821
00:54:24,874 --> 00:54:25,975
Looking for this?

822
00:54:30,214 --> 00:54:31,214
Soo Jin.

823
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,024
What did you just do?

824
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:42,524
You know whose this is.

825
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:44,495
Yes, I do.

826
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,825
So what's the meaning of this?

827
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:48,995
It's because I like you.

828
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:53,535
I see you're not surprised. Were you aware of it?

829
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:56,135
Are you kidding me right now?

830
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:58,544
Aren't you and Ju Kyung friends?

831
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:00,845
We will be if you don't like her.

832
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,374
- What? - She's sweet and warm-hearted.

833
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:06,144
It's why I like her too.

834
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,354
But not as much as I like you though.

835
00:55:10,254 --> 00:55:13,785
If I can't have you, then I'll toss her to the side.

836
00:55:14,084 --> 00:55:15,595
So break up with her if you don't want...

837
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,095
to see her lose a friend and get hurt.

838
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:22,935
You don't seem like the Kang Soo Jin I know.

839
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,535
Why her of all people?

840
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:30,805
You only just met her.

841
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,575
So why is it her when I've been by your side for 10 years?

842
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:38,944
Can't you break up with her and like me instead?

843
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:40,484
You can do that.

844
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:44,714
If I had confessed to you first, you would've chosen me anyway!

845
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:49,725
No.

846
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:52,694
I wouldn't have.

847
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,194
Don't look for the necklace.

848
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,504
Maybe I'll have another.

849
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:44,044
- It's getting late. - Yes, you're right.

850
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:45,484
I shouldn't.

851
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:49,555
I need to slim down and go back to my handsome self.

852
00:56:49,915 --> 00:56:51,584
I doubt the quest will be a success.

853
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:53,955
What? Come on.

854
00:56:54,354 --> 00:56:56,754
I won't be so bad to look once I lose the weight.

855
00:57:00,524 --> 00:57:01,595
I'll see you.

856
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:03,894
But you're not done eating. Where are you going?

857
00:57:06,504 --> 00:57:09,674
What a waste. You make me gain weight.

858
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,655
Could someone have taken it?

859
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:38,035
- Ju Kyung. - Oh my goodness.

860
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,205
I knew you'd still be here.

861
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:46,705
I couldn't give up without looking for it.

862
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:47,905
Don't you know what time it is?

863
00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:50,814
I was going to search over here and call it a night.

864
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:54,544
Then we'll do just that and leave if we come up empty.

865
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:55,814
Sure.

866
00:57:57,555 --> 00:57:59,854
You look over there. I'll look over here.

867
00:58:00,325 --> 00:58:03,354
I just finished looking there. You can help me over here.

868
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:06,894
Still, it won't hurt to check again.

869
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:09,394
I checked down to the last speck of dust.

870
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:10,734
I know it's not there.

871
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:13,234
Are you sure? Like 100 percent?

872
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,935
100 percent?

873
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:18,405
Not to that extent, no.

874
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:21,274
Then go and take another look.

875
00:58:22,975 --> 00:58:24,214
Sure.

876
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:26,745
I searched over here though.

877
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:42,894
Found it!

878
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,205
What a relief.

879
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:52,705
I'm glad.

880
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:55,104
Why did you come here?

881
00:58:57,515 --> 00:59:00,745
See? What would've happened if I hadn't search for it?

882
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:03,185
I know. You did a good job.

883
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:07,285
Let me.

884
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:43,495
Who's there?

885
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:47,225
Let's go.

886
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,674
I'm sure I saw someone.

887
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:06,385
What are you doing here?

888
01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:10,455
Who was that?

889
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:23,334
Maybe I was mistaken.

890
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:28,504
Hee Kyung.

891
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:33,405
- Hee Kyung, are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

892
01:00:34,504 --> 01:00:35,615
Mr. Han?

893
01:00:37,774 --> 01:00:38,915
Hello.

894
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:42,285
Hi.

895
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:53,095
I'm so bored.

896
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:54,464
Should we go to a karaoke room?

897
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:57,095
Hey, how do I look?

898
01:00:57,165 --> 01:00:59,305
- You don't look pretty. - I don't?

899
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:01,935
Gosh, something feels weird.

900
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:03,004
What feels weird?

901
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:07,705
I wonder why Lim Ju Kyung's friend asked for Lim Ju Kyung's photo.

902
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:09,515
What? What are you talking about?

903
01:01:09,575 --> 01:01:11,075
Why couldn't she just take a photo herself?

904
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:13,444
Because they're different people.

905
01:01:15,314 --> 01:01:16,385
What do you mean?

906
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:23,394
I can't believe I was such an idiot.

907
01:01:23,825 --> 01:01:27,124
(Kang Soo Jin)

908
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:29,095
I can't believe her.

909
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:30,595
Kang Soo Jin.

910
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:34,964
You came quick.

911
01:01:34,964 --> 01:01:36,174
You asked us to come here?

912
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,305
Are we here to see her?

913
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:40,544
I actually have something to ask you.

914
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,975
You'd better give me an honest answer.

915
01:01:45,584 --> 01:01:47,385
Is she really who I think she is?

916
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,185
I heard you guys didn't eat.

917
01:01:56,155 --> 01:01:59,424
- Let's eat first and... - Ju Kyung.

918
01:01:59,865 --> 01:02:01,495
What were you doing at school at such a late hour?

919
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:02,935
What about you?

920
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:05,194
I asked you first.

921
01:02:05,365 --> 01:02:07,504
- Add the dumplings. - I was looking for my necklace.

922
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:09,205
"Necklace"? What necklace?

923
01:02:11,475 --> 01:02:12,504
It's pretty.

924
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:13,674
- Did you get it as a gift? - Yes.

925
01:02:14,345 --> 01:02:17,345
Why were you hiding under the table with my homeroom teacher?

926
01:02:17,345 --> 01:02:19,115
- Mr. Han, that goes in later. - Okay.

927
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:20,584
We're dating.

928
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:24,415
So that boyfriend with a fruity face...

929
01:02:26,385 --> 01:02:27,555
was my homeroom teacher?

930
01:02:27,555 --> 01:02:28,785
Are you crazy, Hee Kyung?

931
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:30,024
Yes, I'm crazy in love.

932
01:02:30,024 --> 01:02:31,325
We're two grown-ups with a healthy body and mind,

933
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:32,595
so why can't we fall in love?

934
01:02:32,595 --> 01:02:33,665
It's boiling.

935
01:02:34,825 --> 01:02:38,394
So you were crazy enough to fool around at my school?

936
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:39,604
I wouldn't call it crazy.

937
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,004
I had to work overtime, and my Hee Kyung...

938
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:44,905
I mean, Hee Kyung brought me food.

939
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:47,705
Grapefruit was desperate not to get caught by you...

940
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:50,515
- Grapefruit? - I mean, Joon Woo.

941
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:51,915
Anyway, that's why we hid.

942
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:53,544
Why do you have to date my homeroom teacher?

943
01:02:53,544 --> 01:02:55,515
This is going to make my school life so uncomfortable.

944
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:58,785
Why do you have to date my boss' son?

945
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,624
Or maybe it's okay now since he resigned.

946
01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:03,055
- Anyway! - Couldn't you date anyone else?

947
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:05,524
Grapefruit is special to me!

948
01:03:06,765 --> 01:03:08,294
I told you the glass noodles need to wait.

949
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,495
It needs to boil a bit more.

950
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:12,635
- Are you going to eat fried rice? - Of course.

951
01:03:12,635 --> 01:03:14,035
- You want cheese on top? - Let's eat two servings.

952
01:03:14,035 --> 01:03:15,234
We'd like two servings of fried rice!

953
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:16,334
Can we also have some soda?

954
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,274
- Sure. - My gosh.

955
01:03:19,144 --> 01:03:20,305
Isn't she picking up?

956
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:22,044
This is making me angry.

957
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:24,615
Where did Lim Ju Kyung live again?

958
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:34,385
How did they even meet?

959
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:38,294
How am I going to face Mr. Han tomorrow at school?

960
01:03:38,894 --> 01:03:40,394
Does it make you feel that uncomfortable?

961
01:03:40,794 --> 01:03:41,894
Of course.

962
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:44,535
Now I'll have to be careful of how I behave at school.

963
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:46,865
He'll tell my sister everything.

964
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:52,345
Does Mr. Han look like grapefruit to you?

965
01:03:53,075 --> 01:03:54,104
No.

966
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:57,115
She must be blinded by love.

967
01:03:57,674 --> 01:03:59,115
(Prince Comics)

968
01:04:01,944 --> 01:04:04,084
- Bye, sir. - Bye, sir.

969
01:04:07,655 --> 01:04:09,524
- Is this it? - Is this it?

970
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:10,794
It's this way.

971
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:12,424
- It's this way. - This way?

972
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,265
Are you done with your part-time job?

973
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:34,714
Gosh, it stinks.

974
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:37,254
- Where is it? - Is it over there?

975
01:04:37,714 --> 01:04:39,655
- What a filthy neighborhood. - Seriously.

976
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:40,754
Se Mi.

977
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:43,354
Seo Jun?

978
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:45,765
What are you doing here?

979
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:01,405
We're here.

980
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:03,575
We're here.

981
01:05:07,885 --> 01:05:09,555
My gosh. Seo Jun!

982
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:11,214
Why do you want to meet Ju Kyung?

983
01:05:11,214 --> 01:05:13,725
I haven't seen her in a while, so I wanted to catch up.

984
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:17,555
- You wanted to catch up? - It turns out I know her.

985
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:24,435
- What about it? - Can't you tell?

986
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:27,265
She's Lim Ju Kyung.

987
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:32,274
I guess he doesn't recognize her.

988
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:35,745
What's wrong? Are you shocked?

989
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:38,544
She totally fooled me too.

990
01:05:39,015 --> 01:05:40,544
Why are you showing me this?

991
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:42,655
Because I was worried about you.

992
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:45,984
If you knew about her past, you never would've dated her.

993
01:05:46,424 --> 01:05:49,794
She used to buy dumplings for me back at our school.

994
01:05:49,894 --> 01:05:51,055
She was a complete loser.

995
01:05:51,424 --> 01:05:54,024
She doesn't deserve to date a guy like you.

996
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:57,265
I personally think she's prettier than a brat like you.

997
01:05:57,964 --> 01:06:00,834
What? Are you defending her because she's your girlfriend?

998
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:03,234
Are you blind?

999
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:05,674
- She's pretty thanks to her makeup. - Is that okay with you?

1000
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:08,075
Come on. She looks so ugly with no makeup on. What is wrong...

1001
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:11,774
Seo Jun!

1002
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:15,745
I can't control my anger whenever I see school bullies...

1003
01:06:15,745 --> 01:06:18,085
because it reminds me of my friend.

1004
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:19,524
You made her buy you dumplings?

1005
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:22,995
If I ever catch you bullying other students,

1006
01:06:23,925 --> 01:06:25,094
I swear things won't be pretty.

1007
01:06:33,264 --> 01:06:34,304
That little jerk.

1008
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:39,545
You should go now.

1009
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:42,375
I'll leave once I see you go inside.

1010
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:45,944
Okay, I'll go inside now.

1011
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:47,944
See you tomorrow.

1012
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:46,905
We forgot to do this earlier.

1013
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:56,745
(Welcome to Sebom High School's admission information session.)

1014
01:08:57,344 --> 01:09:00,085
What is all this? It's so embarrassing.

1015
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:13,125
(Welcome to Sebom High School's admission information session.)

1016
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,764
Mom, look at this.

1017
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,295
I'm a school model.

1018
01:09:18,335 --> 01:09:20,134
So she's the queen of Sebom High School?

1019
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:24,175
- Hey. - She's the face of our school?

1020
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,175
Let's go.

1021
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:36,415
(Sebom High School's bright future and cheerful tomorrow)

1022
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:44,594
Come here. Look at this.

1023
01:09:44,995 --> 01:09:46,325
It's unbelievable.

1024
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:49,165
It's crazy. Look at this.

1025
01:09:49,865 --> 01:09:54,304
(Recruiting new students for the 1st semester of 2021)

1026
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,375
That's her.

1027
01:10:03,615 --> 01:10:04,675
My gosh.

1028
01:10:05,644 --> 01:10:06,814
That's her.

1029
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:09,955
Angel? What a joke.

1030
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:17,425
She's an angel?

1031
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:32,075
No way.

1032
01:10:32,535 --> 01:10:33,844
It's very different.

1033
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:38,644
Ju Kyung. Is this really you?

1034
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:43,554
The real face of Saebom High's Lim Ju Kyung.

1035
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:46,325
She was the dumpling girl before she transferred.

1036
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,085
You guys will faint when you see this.

1037
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:50,325
She's mad ugly. It's all makeup.

1038
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:59,165
- She's too ugly. - Unbelievable.

1039
01:10:59,165 --> 01:11:00,604
- I doubt it. - I don't know.

1040
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:06,405
Because you're ugly.

1041
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:15,415
This is too much.

1042
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,295
I can't believe it.

1043
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:45,444
Look at this. My gosh.

1044
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:55,724
Ju Kyung.

1045
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:05,795
Ju Kyung.

1046
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:13,144
Ju Kyung.

1047
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:35,764
(We'd like to thank Chani for his guest appearance.)

1048

(True Beauty)

1049
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:05,024
The kids know what I really look like now.

1050
01:13:05,524 --> 01:13:07,125
So I can't face you.

1051
01:13:08,394 --> 01:13:09,764
Take it down.

1052
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:11,995
No one else would do that garbage but you.

1053
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:13,304
That's not true.

1054
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:16,434
You really didn't know? You and Ju Kyung were best friends.

1055
01:13:16,974 --> 01:13:20,045
Whatever you look like... Whether or not you wear makeup,

1056
01:13:20,205 --> 01:13:21,705
you're always you.

1057
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:26,615
Run as far as you can and hide so no one finds you.

1058
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,854
Don't worry. You can transfer to a school where no one knows you.

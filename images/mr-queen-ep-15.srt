1
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:08,530
(This drama is fictional and all characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,671
(and events are unrelated to historical events.)

3
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,140
If you don't want to talk about it,

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,011
why don't we come up with our own hand signals?

5
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,010
Like this one.

6
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,181
What is that?

7
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,450
This means whatever I'm saying is a lie.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,880
What do you think? It's not that hard.

9
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:33,221
A king never lies.

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,130
(Episode 15)

11
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:00,320
What kind of sin could such a young child commit?

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,661
I smell liquor and something else.

13
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,891
She didn't drink poison.

14
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,831
I cannot believe she was forced to drink poison with such small hands.

15
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:18,171
Her hands are warm. She's still alive.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,581
Please get up.

17
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,650
Dam Hyang!

18
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,721
Your Highness.

19
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,001
- Sir. - You are here.

20
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,100
Sir.

21
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,271
Here you go.

22
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,350
We must not leave such a young child in the mountains.

23
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,850
I would only feel comfortable if I held a funeral for her.

24
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:17,060
- Goodbye, then. - Goodbye.

25
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,381
How's Dam Hyang. Is she okay?

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,090
She should have left the Palace safely by now.

27
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,021
I pardoned her mother, who was a government slave,

28
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,930
and made the preparations so she could leave Hanyang with her.

29
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,331
She's meeting her mom.

30
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,261
She was so worried about her as she only had four fingernails.

31
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,131
Thank goodness. This is great.

32
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,940
How did you do it? Did you use a sleeping pill?

33
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,541
I had her drink mafeisan.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Mafeisan is what the noted doctor Hua Tuo used for surgeries, right?

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,551
You have heard of him.

36
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:11,220
Of course. I've read "Three Kingdoms for Kids" so many times.

37
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,521
"Three Kingdoms for Kids"?

38
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,620
You. You should've told me about your plan beforehand.

39
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,430
It was an urgent situation,

40
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,430
and it was dangerous for many people to know.

41
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,470
Did you hear from Special Director Hong?

42
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:33,240
Yes. He made sure that the child escaped safely.

43
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,541
Good job.

44
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,780
It was reckless to put yourself in such danger...

45
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,581
over a court maid.

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,521
She was not just a court maid.

47
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,120
If I gave up on this child,

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,590
it would become easier to give up on...

49
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,690
10, 100, and then all of my people.

50
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,301
I thought Cheoljong was just a fool,

51
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,671
but he was an incredibly stupid fool.

52
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,171
Don't spend too much time thinking about great things.

53
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,370
You won't live long.

54
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,571
My goal is not to live an embarrassing life.

55
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:11,611
Those are perfect values to have an early death.

56
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,710
This is all your...

57
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,180
This is how she is thanking me.

58
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,121
The language that the Queen uses is different from others.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,621
That "Queen Dictionary" is useless.

60
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:25,720
It's filled with liberal and mistranslations.

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,860
- Did you see it? - You left it open, so I could see.

62
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:32,460
But was the position of queen always this dangerous?

63
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,331
Why is everyone so determined to kill me?

64
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,800
I will prevent this from happening ever again.

65
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,071
No. I will take care of it my way.

66
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,941
The best defense is a good offense.

67
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,251
As of today, I'm the crazy one in this palace.

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,970
(Episode 15, The Crazy X in This Place)

69
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,970
Did you try to get rid of the Queen?

70
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,641
The Queen is on the King's side.

71
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:22,550
She gave our family's embarrassments and weaknesses to the King.

72
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,581
She has fallen for the King and turned her back on her family.

73
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
That is not true.

74
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,290
I am sure you do not want to believe...

75
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,460
that the Queen, whom you adore so much,

76
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,261
is nothing but a foolish woman...

77
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,030
who flounders about after falling for a man.

78
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,001
After I came into this family,

79
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,871
I did whatever you wanted so that you would accept me.

80
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,110
It was not just so that I could remain in this household.

81
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,311
I wanted to become like you...

82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,081
and respect you.

83
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,681
However, the moment you tried to hurt the Queen,

84
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,491
you are no longer my father.

85
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,420
If anyone tries to harm the Queen,

86
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,400
I will be sure to slit their throats.

87
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,201
You can come back home whenever you want.

88
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,641
Even if you do not consider me to be your father,

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,181
you will always be my son.

90
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:42,360
Who would've hidden the ledger in Daejojeon Hall?

91
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,931
The prime suspects...

92
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,960
are the two people who have a grudge against me for no reason.

93
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,470
Queen Dowager Jo and Jo Hwa Jin.

94
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:52,371
If you consider motive, the culprit is Jo Hwa Jin.

95
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,150
Considering how she acted during the hunting game on Surit-nal, I'm sure.

96
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,050
However, Jo Hwa Jin didn't come near Daejojeon Hall recently.

97
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,991
If you consider movement, Queen Dowager Jo is the culprit.

98
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,720
Here.

99
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,561
It's suspicious how she comes here so often these days.

100
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,600
Of course, Queen Dowager Jo also has a clear motive.

101
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,001
Is it the Queen Dowager?

102
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,001
That little raccoon.

103
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:31,840
Then how did the Queen Dowager get her hands on the ledger?

104
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:37,881
That's the mystery.

105
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,790
But more than that, what kind of ledger is it?

106
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,110
I did not have an exorcism today.

107
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,550
I apologize for my rude behavior previously.

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,581
I am sure you would not bow your head for no reason.

109
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,090
What is the reason?

110
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:18,860
As I had expected,

111
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,160
you are quick to read the situation.

112
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,570
Thank you for joining me in this uncomfortable gathering.

113
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,940
I am sure you came to realize from today's events,

114
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,711
It is the time for the nobility to live,

115
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,511
not our families.

116
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,721
We are intimately interdependent.

117
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:46,950
(Literally says "without lips, teeth are cold" and means they're close.)

118
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,091
If 1 of the 2 family ends up in ruins,

119
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,521
the other family will have a hard time staying afloat.

120
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:59,300
That is why I would like to suggest a decree of amnesty...

121
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,700
as a promise of harmony between our two families.

122
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,070
(Granting amnesty for certain criminals for their crimes)

123
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,271
A decree of amnesty?

124
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:06,501
Many wasted talents lost their government posts...

125
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:09,540
due to a momentary mistake in both of our families.

126
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,641
That is why we should make a decree of amnesty to pardon those people.

127
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,721
In other words, it is a symbol of our promise,

128
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,251
and a congratulatory gift.

129
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:20,891
What do you think?

130
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,361
Would you like to join me in this goal?

131
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:56,420
The Ministry of War tried to play dirty tricks to fulfill his greed,

132
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,461
and I am also guilty for being unable to subdue him.

133
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,790
As a result, I, Kim Jwa Geun,

134
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,731
request to step down from my post as Training Commander.

135
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:16,641
Things will not be over for me.

136
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,040
As long as I am breathing.

137
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,330
Eat slowly.

138
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,241
Do you have enough side dishes?

139
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,450
If I had any sense of shame, I would not be able to eat.

140
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,491
Why on earth did you run away?

141
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:08,430
I believe I treated you well until now.

142
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,501
The thing is...

143
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,570
Mother?

144
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:25,381
Mother.

145
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,910
Goodness.

146
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,351
You have been through so much, Dam Hyang.

147
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,950
You have been through so much, Dam Hyang.

148
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,700
It is okay.

149
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:50,501
It will all be okay.

150
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,280
We must try to smile around her.

151
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,780
Her Highness must not...

152
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,521
stay sad for a long time.

153
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,221
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:26,841
Your Highness. It is time for you to wake up.

155
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:36,950
Your Highness.

156
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,391
Were you unable to get any sleep last night?

157
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:45,361
I am worried that you may put a strain on your body.

158
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,790
I have a lot on my mind, so I couldn't get any sleep.

159
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,471
By the way, they probably slept just fine, right?

160
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,741
Who?

161
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,940
The people who tried to mess me up.

162
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,841
That will be the last night they sleep without trouble.

163
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,810
I hope they had a good night's sleep.

164
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,611
- Court Lady Choi. - Yes.

165
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,280
Send someone to my father...

166
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,180
and ask him to come to the palace now.

167
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,550
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,030
Your Highness.

169
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,200
Your father is here.

170
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,170
Already?

171
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:40,310
I was just about to request your attendance at the palace.

172
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,180
But you were already on your way.

173
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,280
Yes.

174
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:49,920
It seems to me I made the right decision to come.

175
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,391
- The other day... - The other day...

176
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,631
You can go first.

177
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,530
No. You can go first.

178
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,971
No. You can go first, Father.

179
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:08,910
- I am sorry about the other day. - I am sorry about the other day.

180
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,841
- No. I should apologize first. - No. I must apologize first.

181
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,211
- I should. - No, I should.

182
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,481
- Gosh. - I should.

183
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,461
Gosh. Blood is thicker than water.

184
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,160
Right.

185
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,800
Well, I asked to see you here today...

186
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,430
because of the ledger.

187
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:42,440
- Did you know about this? - Everyone is going crazy over it.

188
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,641
What is the ledger for?

189
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,851
The ledger has records of our clan's illegal activities.

190
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,420
A weakness of the Andong Kim clan.

191
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,361
That's why Cheoljong wanted to get his hands on that.

192
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:02,461
I actually came here today, so I could talk about the ledger.

193
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:06,430
After you and the King stayed at my house, the ledger disappeared.

194
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,430
So I have been suspecting the King all this time.

195
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:11,670
But a while ago,

196
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:14,711
a trusted and cherished slave of mine ran away.

197
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,280
Luckily, I caught him and asked why he ran away.

198
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,111
The day before the ledger went missing,

199
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,981
he let in Royal Noble Consort Eui.

200
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,790
When things were chaotic at home,

201
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,991
he thought he must have caused trouble and ran away. So...

202
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,591
I am sorry, Your Highness.

203
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,001
It is not your fault.

204
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,070
Now,

205
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,471
I have completed the puzzle.

206
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:49,341
Pardon?

207
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,180
Sunwon was the architect behind my assassination.

208
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,680
I have specially prepared...

209
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,180
ice which is more precious than gold today.

210
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,150
The Queen Dowager indirectly bullied me.

211
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,221
I will serve you my food some time...

212
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,721
I must eat it now.

213
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,371
And Jo Hwa Jin is the one who provided the ammunition.

214
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,371
You should come clean to the King.

215
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,601
You are threatening me.

216
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,400
I heard you...

217
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:22,871
loud and clear.

218
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,820
Father, I have someplace to be right now.

219
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,761
Where?

220
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,290
To open the door to the fiery pit.

221
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,900
I'll make you regret for messing with me.

222
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,371
She used to be as docile as a sika deer.

223
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,540
She has become ferocious over a short period of time here.

224
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:02,280
I know that parents cannot be impartial to their children.

225
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,851
But a sika deer?

226
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,620
If I were to compare her to an animal,

227
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,451
she would be a wild horse.

228
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,320
My daughter is a wild horse?

229
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,451
The tattoo of the Maori people.

230
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,380
The feather from a peacock.

231
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:40,050
And the devil wearing Prada.

232
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,850
Strength is beauty.

233
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,290
Today, I'll be wearing the most beautiful armor.

234
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,630
What do you think?

235
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,630
Good.

236
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,130
Revenge is sweet when served with fireworks.

237
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,731
What is this?

238
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,330
What you see is not everything.

239
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,080
To find out what is inside,

240
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,380
I must cut it in half.

241
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,721
I thought it was just a potato like it seemed.

242
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:49,421
You completely deceived me.

243
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,221
One should not throw away trust and cut it without a good reason.

244
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:55,530
One should make sure what it is before cutting it.

245
00:18:56,991 --> 00:19:00,761
Because once it is done, one cannot take it back.

246
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:04,370
I will serve the drinks now.

247
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,320
I prepared brunch today...

248
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:28,630
because I wanted to return the favor for preparing...

249
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,731
such a lovely brunch the other day.

250
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,271
The cool drink from the last brunch was truly amazing...

251
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:39,070
that I would not have noticed anything even if someone was dead.

252
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,251
Please try it.

253
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,421
I am not thirsty.

254
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:58,021
I put a lot of effort into it. Please at least have a sip.

255
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,661
I said I did not want to.

256
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,191
I went through an ordeal to prepare for that.

257
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,030
If you do not want to drink it...

258
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,350
Ice is better when you bite it.

259
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,060
A while back, I told you that...

260
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,530
I'd help you to stay healthy and young for the rest of your life.

261
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,701
And I will continue to do that.

262
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,300
If you start suspecting food, drinks and anything that goes on your body,

263
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,070
life will be nothing but misery.

264
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,040
Now that the regency had ended,

265
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,011
you must think you can do whatever you want.

266
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:52,711
Do you think...

267
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,880
you can still be the Queen without your clan?

268
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,411
Your Highness.

269
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,451
I don't rely on my clan or my husband.

270
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,751
I'm doing whatever I want because I know what I can.

271
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,060
Oh, right. Head Eunuch.

272
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,501
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,941
I have been neglecting my duty...

274
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,901
to produce an heir.

275
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,880
How could I be so neglectful of my duty as the King?

276
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,780
So go and report to her now.

277
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,550
Report to her?

278
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,221
I do not understand, Your Majesty.

279
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,461
You know you always report to her.

280
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,761
How dare you?

281
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,370
You have given me no choice but to punish you!

282
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,001
Your Majesty, I am sorry.

283
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,840
- Punish me with death. - What is wrong?

284
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,481
I was not speaking to you.

285
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,850
You hold the power of my life now.

286
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:12,290
I do not want that.

287
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,691
What will I do with that?

288
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,431
Please punish me with death, Your Majesty.

289
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,231
My goodness. I do not wish to have such power.

290
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,501
Head Eunuch, I know that you have no choice.

291
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:28,540
You must follow your orders.

292
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:38,011
I would rather have you get angry at me.

293
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,820
This is scarier.

294
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:48,530
How can you be a spy when you are scared so easily?

295
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,630
I have somewhere to go before the royal conference.

296
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,300
Go to Injeongjeon Hall.

297
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,840
My goodness, can you read it somewhere else?

298
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,771
Head Eunuch is in shock right now.

299
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,161
I hope you had a peaceful night.

300
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,330
Is that how you greet your elder?

301
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,201
The hairpieces are heavy.

302
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,211
So I cannot bow my head.

303
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:41,040
This is a sacred place where ancestral rites are performed.

304
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,780
It is not polite to wear such extravagant garments.

305
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,451
You have to preen yourself before asking for a refund.

306
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:52,790
Oh, I'm so forgetful.

307
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,491
I forgot to offer incense to the late King.

308
00:23:56,931 --> 00:24:00,201
I can't believe I disgraced Chunghak-dong School of Etiquette.

309
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,800
Stop it.

310
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,271
I'm extremely faithful to Confucianism.

311
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,211
I can't stand not performing the ritual.

312
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,380
I told you to not touch it.

313
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,151
You left something in my room.

314
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,120
You came unannounced and invaded my privacy.

315
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:27,890
In the end, it was that.

316
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,530
What are you doing?

317
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,530
I told you. A refund.

318
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,401
I should return the nonsense I had to go through.

319
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:40,001
What kind of rudeness is this?

320
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:42,540
Slandering your elder carelessly...

321
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,671
and complaining so hard.

322
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,941
You have always been like that,

323
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,780
but your attitude is even more insolent today.

324
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,951
Is it because you grew up without a mother?

325
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:57,491
You mother-in-law.

326
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:01,021
If I'm rude because I grew up without a mother,

327
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,731
are you rude because you lived without your child?

328
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,201
It's hot.

329
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,671
I'm so mad that I can't stand how hot it is.

330
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:18,040
The portrait of your precious son...

331
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,981
almost burnt.

332
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:22,610
You lost your mind.

333
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,050
Yes, I lost it big time.

334
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:29,751
I think I'm the best among all the girls who lost their minds.

335
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,261
So watch out.

336
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,231
If you touch even a strand of my hair,

337
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,040
you will never see your son's face again.

338
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:22,319
It is not the Queen I should have worried about.

339
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,519
It was other people.

340
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,059
"The best defense is a good offense."

341
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:55,918
Oh, my. I didn't see you were here.

342
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,688
I can't believe how weak your presence is.

343
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:03,658
I'm trying to skip a stone. Would you like to join me?

344
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:04,958
Do it by yourself.

345
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:08,599
The ledger.

346
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,499
You took it.

347
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:15,938
Thanks to the ledger, I almost died.

348
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,738
Tell me.

349
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,079
Is that what you wanted?

350
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:27,878
Did you really not kill O Wol?

351
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,418
No matter what I say, you believe what you want to believe.

352
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,249
I have to take the King away from you,

353
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,418
kill O Wol and put her in the well.

354
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,529
Because it will make me a bad girl who deserves to die...

355
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:41,589
and make you a kind and poor victim.

356
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:47,599
This is why victim playing is scary.

357
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:49,339
Because you're slowly turning into a monster every day,

358
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,269
without even realizing it.

359
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,089
Look at the mirror.

360
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,488
And see how ugly you are.

361
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,519
Hold it yourself to come up.

362
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,819
I don't feel like being too kind right now.

363
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,839
When I fell into the lake in front of you,

364
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,339
you perhaps...

365
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,648
could hold me.

366
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:15,259
This proves...

367
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:19,089
that I'm a better person than you.

368
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,809
Kim Jwa Geun, the former Training Commander,

369
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,309
resigned.

370
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,579
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:44,049
The impeachment process was delayed,

372
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,448
so you all could have taken responsibility for that.

373
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,388
It is a pity.

374
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,329
Oh, it was slip of the tongue.

375
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:55,529
I wanted to say it is fortunate.

376
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:01,369
The next agenda is...

377
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:04,769
Today, there is something I want to declare to you before that.

378
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,878
I will make an office to remove the indictment of the Three Tax System.

379
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,309
Its name is Samjung Ijungchung.

380
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,819
Samjung Ijungchung?

381
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:20,549
It will establish legislation...

382
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,589
and develop detailed plans to solve the fundamental issues...

383
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:24,988
to remedy the problems of the Three Tax System.

384
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,059
Joseon depends on agriculture.

385
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:32,829
The country can prosper only when its farmers prosper.

386
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:36,039
Government officials' exploitation against farmers...

387
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,968
is an act to threaten the foundation of the country,

388
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:41,908
hence it will be punished as high treason.

389
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,708
A careful examination is required to make a new office.

390
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:48,718
You should hear our opinions first before...

391
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:52,289
I accept no compromise to do the right thing.

392
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,688
It means your opinions...

393
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,158
do not matter any longer.

394
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:08,198
Also, I will give the late King Sunjong...

395
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:12,809
the posthumous name of Sunjo according to the rules.

396
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,579
The King is more aggressive than usual today.

397
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,458
Your Majesty.

398
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,228
There is a new appointment today.

399
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:36,158
Chief Royal Secretary also makes a slip of the tongue.

400
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,628
It should be an appointment proposal.

401
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:42,499
The position of Minister of War is vacant now.

402
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,708
A weak military equates to a crisis of the empire.

403
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,009
Therefore, I urge you to appoint the Minister of War...

404
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,678
through the Border Defense Council now.

405
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,779
Come in Minister of War.

406
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,809
Kim Byeong In, the Minister of War, wishes to...

407
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:23,809
offer his greetings.

408
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:41,329
Kim Byeong In can be a threat as he has the Jo clan's support.

409
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,799
Both clans...

410
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,029
have petitioned for amnesties because...

411
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:47,829
That must be his doing as well.

412
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,039
I doubt we can ignore this many appeals.

413
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,779
This might give the upper class an excuse for an uprising.

414
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:00,749
Now that you have full control,

415
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:02,519
you can do whatever you want.

416
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,418
But it is still hard to stop them from going against you.

417
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:07,319
The best defense is a good offense.

418
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,218
Now, it is a matter of...

419
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:12,088
hitting the target faster than our opponent.

420
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,399
We do not have time to recruit more people.

421
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,459
I want you to oversee Ijungchung.

422
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,829
Special Director Hong, I will officially dispatch you...

423
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,298
to visit the three cities in the South...

424
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:24,769
as people are distressed there and launch an investigation.

425
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:27,809
Another business trip?

426
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,008
Do this for me.

427
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,218
The more time passes by, you two stay here and give orders.

428
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:41,048
I feel like I am doing all the heavy lifting by myself. Am I wrong?

429
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,559
No, you are not alone. I always...

430
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:47,488
Once you are done with this investigation,

431
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,999
- I could give you a few days off. - I will get ready for my trip.

432
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:53,528
"I could."

433
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,468
I said I could.

434
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,769
I doubt that he heard that.

435
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,608
That fool.

436
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,979
Your Majesty.

437
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:09,218
You have a letter, Your Majesty.

438
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,388
I will not harm you. Come closer.

439
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,829
The Queen has sent a letter to Your Majesty.

440
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,838
Are you sick?

441
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:34,908
You are so fragile.

442
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:43,419
Revenge is something else. I thought I would be elated.

443
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:50,758
It was exhilarating.

444
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,658
What a thrill.

445
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,229
His Majesty is...

446
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,008
You're here.

447
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,849
You seem especially more beautiful today.

448
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:20,988
That suits you well.

449
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:23,019
Everything looks good with a pretty face.

450
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,789
So anything looks good on me.

451
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,528
Who knew I would make a great queen?

452
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,169
I can never get used to that.

453
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,198
I asked to see you,

454
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:40,439
so we can form an alliance.

455
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:44,479
My clan probably left me, thinking I am on your side.

456
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,408
So I've got nothing to lose.

457
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,608
If you are on my side,

458
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,048
your clan will become your enemy.

459
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,789
The clan ditched me first.

460
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,948
So I'll ditch my clan now.

461
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,088
If we have the same enemy, doesn't that make us allies?

462
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:09,068
Yes.

463
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:14,669
Starting now, the no-touching rule does not apply between us.

464
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,278
Sure. No more no-touching rule.

465
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:22,749
In martial arts movies,

466
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:25,048
I saw they drip their blood in a cup and drink it together.

467
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,088
But I can't do something like that as it's unsanitary.

468
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:31,019
Let's drink tea and celebrate our alliance.

469
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:32,158
It will be nice and simple.

470
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,229
What...

471
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,338
Is this what allies do?

472
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,238
Yes. This is how it's done.

473
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,608
- Bottoms up. - What...

474
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,588
Now that we're allies, let's clear the air.

475
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,789
Why did you try to kill me?

476
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,588
Right.

477
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,158
It is a topic we must discuss at some point.

478
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,968
We thought you heard our conversation...

479
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,698
about assassinating your father.

480
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,869
He is still your father-in-law.

481
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,869
To me, he was one of the corrupted officials.

482
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,508
You are so harsh.

483
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,209
I get it. You even tried to kill your own wife.

484
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:27,948
You're a serial killer of the Kims.

485
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:30,079
I am sorry.

486
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,019
I know that my apology does not mean much now,

487
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,258
but there were many misunderstandings and situations.

488
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:38,358
Okay.

489
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:40,789
Then, you owe me one.

490
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:42,499
I won't forgive you until you pay me back somehow.

491
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:46,099
So what are you trying to achieve?

492
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:47,568
Strengthening the sovereign authority?

493
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:51,838
That is only a tool to fix our broken empire.

494
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,608
I do not think the root of the world can change.

495
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:58,738
So to be honest, I like your tool, rather than your goal.

496
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:00,979
If the sovereign authority is strengthened, I'll be strong too.

497
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:03,349
Then, no one can come after me.

498
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,448
I am well aware of the fear that comes from a death threat.

499
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,218
I know you are acting tough, but you must be scared.

500
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:13,888
I'm not sure.

501
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,258
Is it because I died once?

502
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:18,059
I hate being trampled on more than dying.

503
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:22,399
If I can chew out all those people trying to trample on me,

504
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,709
I will die with a smile.

505
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,379
Your Highness.

506
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:32,309
It is time to prepare lunch.

507
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,548
Okay. On that note,

508
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,548
I'll go do that.

509
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,599
I will die with a smile.

510
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,068
"Die with a smile".

511
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,619
- Lord Kim. - Hey. Byeong In.

512
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:22,028
I mean, Minister of War.

513
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:25,559
- Are you teasing me? - Gosh, no.

514
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,729
Please call me by my name.

515
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,298
Actually, I was waiting for you...

516
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:34,608
because I wanted to talk about the Queen with you.

517
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,079
As it so happens, I had something to tell you about her as well.

518
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,028
Where did I put it?

519
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:57,059
Where did I put it?

520
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,399
- Hold on. - I saw it.

521
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:08,869
You!

522
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,948
How dare you use the knife? You have not been here long enough.

523
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,278
Things are different now.

524
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:21,849
Chef these days never want to drink some makgeolli after work.

525
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:24,218
They always say no. My goodness.

526
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:27,028
I said it would be my treat. I do not know why they say no.

527
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,028
Goodness.

528
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,068
I do not understand the court maids these days.

529
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:38,099
I told them to come late, and they really came late.

530
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,939
They should have been there before their scheduled time.

531
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,379
- Kids these days. - Kids these days.

532
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:48,178
This is for Tongmyeongjeon Hall.

533
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:56,818
Darn it.

534
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,888
I had one more revenge left.

535
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:01,789
A recipe for revenge?

536
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,269
I should do exactly what he did to me, right?

537
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:10,669
A tooth for a tooth. An eye for an eye.

538
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,608
A loss of manhood for a loss of manhood.

539
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:16,408
Then, brackens?

540
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,778
- Adlay? - Brackens and adlay.

541
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,079
This recipe has a lot of healthy ingredients.

542
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,479
It will take forever to achieve my goal with food.

543
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,388
That's too long of a plan.

544
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:29,919
Let's go big.

545
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:34,189
- Castration. - Castration?

546
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:36,829
I have never heard...

547
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,698
Oh, I see.

548
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,638
It is such a precious ingredient.

549
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:50,039
I am not here to burden you.

550
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:53,448
I am a man who knows when to give up.

551
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,349
I apologize.

552
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:56,548
You do not need to.

553
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,318
May I ask you a question for the last time?

554
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,959
- Yes. - Why do you...

555
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,059
dislike a man who has ambition?

556
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:14,729
While living in the Palace, I have seen many ambitious people...

557
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:18,099
and their difficult ends.

558
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:20,169
I do not like...

559
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,539
and am afraid of such things.

560
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:26,948
Thank you for answering my question.

561
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:40,428
If I could dare expect something from you,

562
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:43,829
it is that your bright smile...

563
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,329
will remain forever.

564
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:48,129
Oh, it is you.

565
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:53,809
It must be over.

566
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,079
Your intuition is as sharp as a sickle.

567
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:57,678
You are so quick-witted.

568
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,879
How could I not know when you are crying like this?

569
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:03,678
Do not look at me.

570
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:09,619
I do not want anyone to see me like this.

571
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:13,189
Then go over there and cry on your own.

572
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:15,629
People might think that I made you cry.

573
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:17,758
It was not me.

574
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:22,568
I will not cry anymore.

575
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,968
Being able to end my feelings cleanly is a part of love.

576
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,379
It may be harder than continuing to love her.

577
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,778
You have become quite the poet.

578
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:37,149
Let us go. Stop crying.

579
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,229
She insisted on sending me a meal?

580
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:56,099
What is with this ominous drawing?

581
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:59,709
Goodness, it is so pretty.

582
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,939
Court Lady Chun. You would survive even after consuming poison...

583
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,709
because you are so slow-witted.

584
00:44:06,149 --> 00:44:08,479
Why are you complimenting me all of a sudden?

585
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,099
Your Highness.

586
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:35,108
I, Shim Ong of the Han clan, am here to say hello.

587
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:41,979
Have we not met before?

588
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,088
I am much obliged.

589
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,718
No, I mean... Please forgive me.

590
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,358
I believe you should be saying something else to me.

591
00:44:55,689 --> 00:44:56,899
For example,

592
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:00,129
"Punish me with death, Your Highness".

593
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:04,769
I lost all the popcorn I worked so hard to make because of you.

594
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:07,209
I lost it all because it went flying.

595
00:45:07,908 --> 00:45:11,809
I had no idea you were the Queen,

596
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:16,778
and I committed such a huge crime.

597
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,448
You had no idea it was me?

598
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:23,689
Then why did you run away?

599
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:25,789
That is because...

600
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,528
such a noble person was running after me,

601
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,258
so I was surprised.

602
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:33,928
I did not have any other reasons.

603
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:35,129
Is that so?

604
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,738
To be honest, I called you here...

605
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,908
to give you a government post.

606
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,919
It is a good position. You don't need to worry about getting fired,

607
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:52,988
and the pay is good too.

608
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,189
Of course, you end up losing something else.

609
00:45:57,218 --> 00:45:58,289
Pardon?

610
00:46:00,129 --> 00:46:01,488
Did you just say I would lose something?

611
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:06,068
When I saw you, despite it being a brief meeting,

612
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:08,099
your physiognomy is perfect for this position.

613
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,638
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

614
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:14,408
You...

615
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:16,979
should become my eunuch.

616
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:18,278
What?

617
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,749
Hold on. Wait a second.

618
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:24,019
Let go of me, you eunuchs.

619
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:26,919
Your Highness.

620
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:28,948
I beg your kindness.

621
00:46:28,948 --> 00:46:30,689
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

622
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,858
Why are you doing this to me?

623
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:35,289
First,

624
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,858
you bought a fake family register and pretended to be a noble.

625
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:40,468
No. This isn't your fault.

626
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:43,068
The social structure that divides classes is to blame.

627
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:44,669
That is correct.

628
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,108
Let's go again. First,

629
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,169
you put poisonous herbs in the water of the Royal Kitchen...

630
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:51,278
and ruined the King's banquet.

631
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:53,879
Second,

632
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,948
your descendant is a bad person.

633
00:46:57,278 --> 00:46:58,278
"My descendant"?

634
00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:01,818
Are you sure you did not mix it up with my ancestors?

635
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:03,758
No.

636
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:05,959
I'm certain.

637
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,499
Your descendant is a bad person.

638
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:13,229
My descendant?

639
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:15,698
Your Highness.

640
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:17,669
If I become a eunuch, I will not have any descendants.

641
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,138
If I become a eunuch, I will not have any descendants. Your Highness!

642
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:23,439
I will not have any descendants.

643
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,539
Hey, do you have any descendants? You do not, right?

644
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:28,249
I will not be able to have any descendants!

645
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:31,579
My gosh. Your Highness!

646
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,729
Your Highness, the Ministry of War is here.

647
00:47:50,939 --> 00:47:52,169
Your Highness,

648
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:54,269
The Andong Kim clan.

649
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:56,479
I'm certain they're all in cahoots.

650
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:59,309
But my father is also a part of the Andong Kim clan.

651
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:02,678
What? I just naturally called him "my father".

652
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:08,019
The transfer of emotions is serious.

653
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,329
I figured out what had happened to you after I met you yesterday.

654
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:16,329
I had no idea you went through such a big ordeal.

655
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:18,358
You had no idea...

656
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,298
that they tried to kill me?

657
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:23,399
I am not on my father's side, nor am I a part of the Kim clan.

658
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:26,838
However, you aren't free from either of them.

659
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,539
You will find out eventually.

660
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:44,758
Is he an enemy or an ally?

661
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,899
How dare he do that to So Yong?

662
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:06,349
Even still, how could he do that to the Queen?

663
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,218
Kim Jwa Geun, that jerk.

664
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,519
I ought to...

665
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,428
Furthermore, it's Samjung Ijungchung.

666
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:29,198
They're using the corruption of the leaders as an excuse...

667
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,899
to try to bring down our family.

668
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:33,238
Do not worry.

669
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:36,439
If they try to find a problem with it by calling it exploitation,

670
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:38,278
then nobody is innocent.

671
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:41,649
In order to protect themselves,

672
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:44,149
they will all try to protect the leaders,

673
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:48,019
so all that will be left of Samjung Ijungchung is its shell.

674
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,358
Even if you join them temporarily,

675
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,189
do not even blink in front of Queen Dowager Jo.

676
00:49:56,658 --> 00:49:59,059
She may smile in front of you,

677
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,169
but she is always ready to stab you in the back.

678
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,568
I will keep that in mind.

679
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,698
Court Lady Chun.

680
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:08,309
Yes, Your Highness.

681
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,539
Clear the table and call in Nurse Park.

682
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,408
Yes, Your Highness.

683
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:18,718
Are you already done eating?

684
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,448
I don't have much of an appetite.

685
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:24,289
I heard that you were quite satisfied...

686
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,059
with the meals that the Queen prepared for you.

687
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:29,088
It was not that great.

688
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:31,329
It was just edible.

689
00:50:31,758 --> 00:50:34,169
The Queen is very heartbroken.

690
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:38,499
She said that Royal Noble Consort Eui came between you,

691
00:50:38,499 --> 00:50:41,508
and she was mistaken to believe that our family turned our backs on her.

692
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,678
She is blaming herself.

693
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,249
Royal Noble Consort Eui?

694
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:49,309
I heard it from the Queen's father today.

695
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:52,019
The person that deceived you was not the Queen.

696
00:50:53,249 --> 00:50:54,488
It was Royal Noble Consort Eui.

697
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,258
The King is here.

698
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,229
Tell him to come in.

699
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:17,678
Your Majesty.

700
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,608
I apologize for coming at such a late hour without any notice.

701
00:51:21,508 --> 00:51:22,709
It is okay.

702
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:25,619
It is an honor regardless of when you come.

703
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,149
I came to tell you something.

704
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,588
What is it?

705
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:36,698
It is about the body of the court made found in the well recently.

706
00:51:38,158 --> 00:51:40,968
The Queen Dowager hired someone to do that.

707
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:43,638
Queen Dowager did it?

708
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,369
Why would she...

709
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,408
Can you not think of the reason either?

710
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,508
If so, the body is...

711
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:55,048
It must not be O Wol's.

712
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,349
It is impossible. It was definitely O Wol.

713
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:01,189
I heard it was difficult to identify due to the condition of the body.

714
00:52:01,189 --> 00:52:03,218
Why were you sure that it was O Wol?

715
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:05,919
She was wearing a garment for court maid,

716
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:09,689
and O Wol was the only court maid who had disappeared.

717
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:15,568
She knew that you would think she is O Wol.

718
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,338
What the Queen Dowager wants...

719
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:21,468
is you relying on her.

720
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:24,579
But why did it have to be the well of all?

721
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:28,948
I told her what I had gone through in the well.

722
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:33,718
The well is a place where I met you.

723
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,519
But it is also a place that hurt me.

724
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,888
It reminded me of you,

725
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:41,189
so I was sure I lost the person I cherished.

726
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:46,158
Now I realize I cannot carelessly reveal my wound to others...

727
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:48,629
in the palace.

728
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:11,189
Drag the Queen down to the nightmare I am living in.

729
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:20,369
You should never trust the Queen Dowager from now on.

730
00:53:21,028 --> 00:53:22,369
We should hide that we know it,

731
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:25,939
so do not let her know that you know what she did.

732
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,379
I am also deeply disappointed and feel betrayed by her.

733
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:34,278
The well is a place...

734
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,678
that instills fear in me.

735
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,849
I cannot believe she used it.

736
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:57,698
It's similar to poker and hwatu.

737
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:00,138
Gabbling and gaming...

738
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:03,068
are surely the best ways to waste your time and life.

739
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:05,479
I am glad to hear that.

740
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,579
We were worried you might have a hard time because of Dam Hyang.

741
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:12,019
Please forgive me.

742
00:54:13,218 --> 00:54:15,689
Don't worry. Dam Hyang went to a good place.

743
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,919
Right? She must have gone to a good place, right?

744
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,129
Dam Hyang.

745
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:27,769
I mean... A really good place.

746
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:28,829
Yes, Your Highness.

747
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:31,838
Dam Hyang...

748
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:36,269
I said she really went to a good place.

749
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,948
Why are you crying?

750
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:43,108
My apologies.

751
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:45,349
Come to think of it,

752
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:49,419
I couldn't even say farewell to her.

753
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,059
Dam Hyang.

754
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,459
- Dam Hyang. - Your Highness.

755
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:02,198
Dam Hyang.

756
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:03,769
Seven.

757
00:55:05,939 --> 00:55:06,939
Eight.

758
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:08,869
This is...

759
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:12,008
called nine.

760
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,278
Please forgive me.

761
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,218
Darn it.

762
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:25,318
- Dam Hyang. - Dam Hyang.

763
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:27,858
All in.

764
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:34,994
How did Queen Dowager get the ledger?

765
00:55:35,094 --> 00:55:37,795
The ledger we tried so hard to find but failed.

766
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:42,895
At this point, would it not be the right choice to recruit her?

767
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:45,735
It is a joke.

768
00:55:46,435 --> 00:55:49,605
Hearing she is better than me who can freely roam outside the palace,

769
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:50,875
I am disappointed in myself.

770
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:54,375
Queen Dowager mostly stays at Seonwonjeon Hall.

771
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,674
I cannot understand how she got the ledger.

772
00:55:57,014 --> 00:55:58,744
The fact that she faked the corpse...

773
00:55:59,215 --> 00:56:01,954
means she has people working for her.

774
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:04,384
Should we recruit them then?

775
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:07,695
Is the composite of the one with a goblin mask not available yet?

776
00:56:08,224 --> 00:56:11,065
I have been too busy with work these days.

777
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,424
Freeing Dam Hyang's mother from slavery...

778
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,364
and finding her missing father.

779
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:17,134
You could not find her father though, did you?

780
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:19,505
How can I find a person who is hiding in the mountains?

781
00:56:19,804 --> 00:56:21,505
He must have become a bandit.

782
00:56:25,204 --> 00:56:28,915
Thinking about the holiday...

783
00:56:28,915 --> 00:56:30,784
after the business trip as a royal investigator,

784
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:35,514
I am barely enduring it these days.

785
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:39,125
Hey, what I meant was the holiday...

786
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:44,665
Can you appoint me...

787
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,295
as a secret inspector, not a royal investigator.

788
00:56:46,295 --> 00:56:47,864
That is cooler.

789
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:50,764
After hiding my identity, I will show them the tablet, like this!

790
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:55,304
You are a born secret inspector. Do it as you want.

791
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:57,505
One more time.

792
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:27,904
I didn't think Great Lord Yeongeun was that kind of person.

793
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:30,404
Kim Jwa Geun is the one who deserves to die.

794
00:57:30,404 --> 00:57:31,505
Great Lord Yeongeun is...

795
00:57:34,074 --> 00:57:36,014
my only family.

796
00:57:48,195 --> 00:57:51,125
Hey, are you sleeping after trying to kill...

797
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,364
your father-in-law and wife?

798
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:55,695
Oh, you're not.

799
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:14,554
Calm down, my heart.

800
00:58:15,185 --> 00:58:17,025
It hurts my pride.

801
00:59:20,755 --> 00:59:23,085
She was in the water for a long time.

802
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:27,454
How suffocating and painful must it have been?

803
00:59:30,154 --> 00:59:32,895
Finding her body in the well is either an awful coincidence...

804
00:59:33,264 --> 00:59:35,494
or someone is trying to come between us.

805
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,054
I was too deep in my thoughts.

806
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:55,884
You must have been deeply shocked.

807
00:59:56,185 --> 00:59:58,085
The palace is too big for me.

808
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,855
Not only it makes you lonely, but it also makes you lost.

809
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:06,125
I found the court maid who sold the norigae you had given to O Wol.

810
01:00:06,695 --> 01:00:09,094
She said she only found the norigae buried at the palace.

811
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:12,165
Is that so?

812
01:00:12,165 --> 01:00:13,804
She is the very court maid who put the dead body in the well...

813
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:16,134
by Queen Dowager's order.

814
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,304
O Wol is alive.

815
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:20,674
She was attacked in the palace.

816
01:00:21,545 --> 01:00:23,884
She could not even step foot outside the palace.

817
01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:27,614
Do you not have to wish...

818
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:30,284
the dead body found in the well is not O Wol?

819
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:33,625
Do you not have to be happy...

820
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:35,295
that there is a possibility that it is not O Wol's dead body?

821
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:38,625
Why do you believe that the corpse is O Wol?

822
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:39,994
What on earth...

823
01:00:42,895 --> 01:00:44,935
What on earth are you hiding?

824
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:50,474
Last time,

825
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,514
what did you hand over...

826
01:00:57,284 --> 01:00:58,614
to the Queen Dowager?

827
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:10,764
Did you see it?

828
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:12,565
I...

829
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:18,005
can see nothing without your permission.

830
01:01:22,775 --> 01:01:24,704
Anyone can be lost sometimes.

831
01:01:25,145 --> 01:01:27,145
You still have a chance to get back on track.

832
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:32,614
What if I am not lost just for a moment?

833
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,114
Can I still...

834
01:01:36,415 --> 01:01:38,525
get back on track?

835
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:43,525
I cannot go back.

836
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:45,125
Your Highness.

837
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:47,864
The dead body has to be O Wol.

838
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,344
Why are you making samhyang ramyeon...

839
01:02:01,045 --> 01:02:02,545
in the middle of the night?

840
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,784
Why do you crave ramyeon especially at night?

841
01:02:08,784 --> 01:02:11,324
You know it will make your face puffy the next morning.

842
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:15,125
Yet it's so hard to fight the temptation.

843
01:02:17,695 --> 01:02:20,295
You worked hard but it is a shame that there is not a chance.

844
01:02:20,295 --> 01:02:22,364
Grand Queen Dowager does not eat...

845
01:02:22,494 --> 01:02:24,105
late at night.

846
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:25,804
So instead of her, let me...

847
01:02:28,074 --> 01:02:29,235
No.

848
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,435
You should have told me that you came.

849
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:02,875
Why did you just stand there knocking on the door?

850
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,915
Do you want to have ramyeon before you go?

851
01:03:16,614 --> 01:03:19,954
What is ramyeon? And where do you want me to go?

852
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,994
No pressure. It's just a kind of research.

853
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:25,395
Or a test.

854
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:28,295
No. I shouldn't do this.

855
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:32,005
But if it's just a bite...

856
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,005
No, no.

857
01:03:33,204 --> 01:03:35,335
Ramyeon has such an addictive taste.

858
01:03:35,335 --> 01:03:37,505
Once you start eating it, you can't stop.

859
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:40,304
What are you doing?

860
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:46,384
An inner conflict.

861
01:03:53,755 --> 01:03:55,355
What would you do if it were you?

862
01:03:55,724 --> 01:03:58,465
Do you think you're going to eat ramyeon or not?

863
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:01,435
I think I will explain what ramyeon is first.

864
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,935
- First, - First?

865
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:07,875
I will try it.

866
01:04:08,404 --> 01:04:09,435
Right?

867
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:12,074
You know how it is only after you try it.

868
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:14,014
If it's just a one-time thing as I was drunk,

869
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:15,545
or if I have really gone mad,

870
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:17,244
or if this is...

871
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:20,244
real.

872
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:24,324
Are we speaking the same language right now?

873
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:26,224
Sure.

874
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:28,695
We're talking about the ramyeon.

875
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:33,494
Come closer. Ramyeon is the best when it's hot.

876
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,665
(Dongmongseonseup)

877
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:36,935
What are you doing with this?

878
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:38,735
Oh, my!

879
01:04:38,735 --> 01:04:40,605
What should I do? This is such a precious book.

880
01:04:56,755 --> 01:04:59,224
What do you think this is that you said it is precious?

881
01:05:01,424 --> 01:05:05,165
Why is Dongmongseonseup precious to you?

882
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:08,395
It's...

883
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:11,465
Was it you?

884
01:05:14,574 --> 01:05:17,304
The person who saved me. Was it you?

885
01:05:17,474 --> 01:05:19,974
Did you save me from the well?

886
01:05:33,284 --> 01:05:34,295
Yes.

887
01:05:35,094 --> 01:05:36,195
It was me.

888
01:05:49,304 --> 01:05:53,704
(Mr. Queen)

889
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:17,164
My Cheoljong will be desperately waiting for me to come.

890
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:19,435
Did you dig a trap?

891
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:22,504
I cannot believe the fight the Queen declared was real.

892
01:06:22,504 --> 01:06:24,044
- Is it my turn? - Draw your sword.

893
01:06:24,044 --> 01:06:27,205
If someone did not clean up after himself and leaves a trace,

894
01:06:27,205 --> 01:06:29,145
he will have to take responsibility for everything.

895
01:06:29,145 --> 01:06:30,214
Even though I removed the Kim clan,

896
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:32,115
Kim Byeong In is becoming more powerful.

897
01:06:32,115 --> 01:06:33,985
I feel like there is no progress.

898
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:37,155
If Cheoljong makes it, the world 200 years later will change as well.

899
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:39,185
As long as I'm on your side, you will win.

900
01:06:39,185 --> 01:06:40,955
I have a secret weapon.

901
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,294
I know the future.

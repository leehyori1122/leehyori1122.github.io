1
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,482
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,321
- Okay, sir. - Sir.

3
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:20,261
- What's going on? - Was this really necessary?

4
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,261
Ms. Lim, what are you doing?

5
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:25,092
I get that you didn't want Se Yeon's name...

6
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,801
to become an issue again.

7
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,502
But how could you even steal his song...

8
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:30,801
to cover up your mistake?

9
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,441
- What is she talking about? - It's nothing, sir.

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,911
He doesn't care about the rookies.

11
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,341
- Let's go. Let's talk outside. - Let go.

12
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:41,841
I said, let go!

13
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,392
You had a reporter publish an article...

14
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:55,691
about Se Yeon being a bully in school...

15
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,892
to prevent this photo of you and the actress from becoming an issue.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,402
If you felt even the slightest bit of responsibility about his death,

17
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,271
you shouldn't have done this.

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,871
Even if this song has no copyright, this is still plagiarism.

19
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:10,572
How dare you barge in here and talk all that nonsense?

20
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:12,141
Come on.

21
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,641
Se Yeon and Leo are only 18.

22
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,652
You also have a son yourself.

23
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:19,481
If you feel bad for doing this to these kids...

24
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,882
who are young enough to be your son,

25
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:22,852
you should set things straight.

26
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,261
It's better for you to take care of this yourself...

27
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,561
rather than to have me blow the whistle on you.

28
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:35,361
Are you threatening me right now?

29
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,302
Think whatever you want.

30
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,272
I came to tell you this knowing I could get fired.

31
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,141
Have you lost your mind?

32
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,111
I'll leave on my own.

33
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:02,761
Soo Ho.

34
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,462
Soo Ho.

35
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,202
Soo Ho!

36
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,071
Did you hear the song?

37
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,612
The song that was released by Move Entertainment.

38
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,142
That jerk. Hey!

39
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:22,881
Soo Ho!

40
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,131
Guys, what do you think? Should we get one each?

41
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:39,131
- It's not so bad. - Oh, please. It's too childish.

42
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,802
Try one on. Let me help.

43
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,142
There. Let's see how they look.

44
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,512
Don't you ever take this off.

45
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:52,682
Right back at you.

46
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,302
- Congratulations, congratulations - Congratulations, congratulations

47
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:24,012
- Congratulations on Se Yeon's debut - Congratulations on Se Yeon's debut

48
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:27,541
- Congratulations. - Why didn't you tell me about this?

49
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,381
I just felt bad.

50
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,612
Why would you feel bad?

51
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:33,582
You became a trainee before me, so it's natural you start first.

52
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,121
Congratulations, Se Yeon.

53
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,992
- My gosh. - Get over here.

54
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,721
- Look at him. - Nice.

55
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:41,762
I came up with one. "Leo". What do you think? Nice, right?

56
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,962
"Leo". It suits you, Soo Ho.

57
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,762
Leo and Se Yeon.

58
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,131
Will you guys give me this song after I make a debut?

59
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,471
Why would we give this to you?

60
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,601
- What? - I'm going to sing a duet with you.

61
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:55,971
Who says?

62
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:59,712
- Let me hear you guys sing first. - What? Is it an audition or what?

63
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,411
- What? - An audition sounds nice.

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,611
("Missing You")

65
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:01,772
Hurry.

66
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,752
(Emergency Ward)

67
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,562
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

68
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,491
Soo Ho! Please open the door, Soo Ho.

69
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:25,091
Soo Ho!

70
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,861
Please let me in.

71
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,332
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

72
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,971
- Isn't he Jeong Se Yeon? - "Jeong Se Yeon"?

73
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:33,872
The guy who committed school violence.

74
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,801
Oh, that guy who was on the real-time search list?

75
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,312
It's a huge issue.

76
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,671
But what's he doing here?

77
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,181
(Se Yeon)

78
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:46,421
Reporter Choi, Mr. Lee's too busy to date anyone.

79
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,921
They only went for drinks after filming was wrapped up.

80
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:52,921
A sponsor? That's an absurd rumor...

81
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:55,692
Of course.

82
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:02,402
(Jeong Se Yeon)

83
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:13,442
(Jeong Se Yeon)

84
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,252
("Was Jeong SE Yeon of N-6IX a School Bully?")

85
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,122
(People who commit school violence all deserve to die.)

86
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,421
(He should be socially ostracized. Is he not sorry at all?)

87
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:25,921
(It must be true seeing that his agency isn't defending him.)

88
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:27,462
(I hope the victims cheer up. The truth is getting revealed.)

89
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,101
But I didn't do it.

90
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:38,502
I didn't do anything.

91
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,671
I really didn't do it.

92
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,171
It was Jeong Se Yeon who committed suicide.

93
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,402
- The K-pop idol singer? - Really?

94
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,411
- You can't cross the line. - Please step back.

95
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:28,022
(Police)

96
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:53,981
(Boyfriend)

97
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:00,721
(Boyfriend)

98
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:11,231
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

99
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:29,981
Ju Kyung.

100
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,252
What are you doing here at this hour?

101
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,781
I have something to tell you.

102
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:37,992
Something to tell me?

103
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:41,791
I don't think I should postpone this any longer.

104
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,092
Soo Jin, the truth is,

105
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:51,571
I'm going out with Soo Ho.

106
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,972
I also like him a lot.

107
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:04,281
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

108
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,482
I wanted you to be the first to know.

109
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,752
But when you told me you had feelings for him,

110
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:13,421
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

111
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,632
I was scared we might drift apart.

112
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,701
I didn't want to lose you.

113
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,701
But...

114
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:30,242
I just couldn't keep lying to you.

115
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,811
I'm so sorry.

116
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,222
I see.

117
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:43,421
I'd be lying if I told you I'm okay.

118
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,522
It's upsetting.

119
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:47,791
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:51,392
But this isn't the first time I felt this way...

121
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,132
toward Soo Ho.

122
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,061
And back then, it didn't last long.

123
00:09:56,632 --> 00:10:00,142
When you're friends with someone for a long time, it's normal...

124
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:01,941
to get confused every now and then.

125
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,571
That's just all it is.

126
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:08,482
So you don't need to feel so bad about it.

127
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:12,882
- Soo Jin. - You're making me feel like...

128
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:14,752
I gave you a hard time by telling you how I feel.

129
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,821
So don't cry.

130
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:19,992
You didn't do anything wrong. Look at me.

131
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,321
I just feel so bad.

132
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:24,831
I'm so sorry.

133
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,431
Soo Ho likes you.

134
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,102
So there's nothing I can do.

135
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:36,512
Once I get over him,

136
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:40,112
your relationship with Soo Ho and our friendship...

137
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:42,112
will stay the same.

138
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,112
I look even more ugly now that my eyes are all swollen.

139
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,392
(Boyfriend)

140
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:37,632
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

141
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,772
Is he still angry?

142
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:46,581
Did he get into an accident because he got shocked by what I said?

143
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,281
What are you doing outside?

144
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:52,911
I just feel a bit frustrated.

145
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,421
Why did you come outside? You'll catch a cold. Go back inside.

146
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,852
I also feel frustrated. I want to get some fresh air.

147
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:00,892
Is there something wrong?

148
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,622
It's nothing.

149
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,262
Hee Kyung, what's the matter with me?

150
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,571
What do you mean?

151
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,531
Every time something happens,

152
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,571
I always end up hiding because I get too scared.

153
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,311
That makes things more complicated,

154
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,911
and I end up hurting people even though I don't mean to.

155
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:24,711
Why can't I just be honest from the start?

156
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,921
I can be too careless at times.

157
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,722
And you get scared too easily.

158
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,191
From now on, try being more honest.

159
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,392
Look what happened to Dad.

160
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,301
He should've just told us that he got scammed.

161
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,232
But he tried to handle it on his own...

162
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,402
only to end up with a bigger debt.

163
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:49,472
And because of that, we had to sell our apartment and move back here.

164
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,142
I'm sorry, girls.

165
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,512
Dad. Dad. He's crying again.

166
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,022
How long was he there?

167
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,222
He could've told us he was there.

168
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:07,622
By the way, did you say you're friends with my boss' son?

169
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:08,791
Lee Soo Ho?

170
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,191
Yes. Why?

171
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:13,461
He got into a car accident in front of the company building.

172
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,461
What?

173
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,701
A car accident?

174
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,571
Soo Ho.

175
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,711
Soo Ho.

176
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,461
You can go.

177
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,931
I can't rest comfortably if you two are here.

178
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:00,242
Still, I can't leave you alone. It's uncomfortable with the cast.

179
00:15:00,242 --> 00:15:02,642
Go. I'm just going to sleep anyway.

180
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,171
You're so stubborn.

181
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:07,441
Then I'll come back in the morning with your stuff.

182
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,882
You should've been careful. We were so scared.

183
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,382
Go, go. I want to sleep.

184
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:15,081
- Call me if you need anything. - Okay.

185
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,421
Go back in.

186
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:39,242
Is Soo Ho okay?

187
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,612
Explain what Ms. Lim said earlier.

188
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:45,811
Well...

189
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,492
In order to bury your scandal last year...

190
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,352
What?

191
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,331
Nothing happened.

192
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:08,242
How could I possibly date someone that young?

193
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:12,842
We live in the same building, so I drove her home after a party.

194
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,281
They say living in the same building proves you have a relationship,

195
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,612
so they plan to publish an article on Monday.

196
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:24,622
Stop it. What would Soo Ho think?

197
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,161
He won't talk to me as is.

198
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,031
It may hurt our merger.

199
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,262
Use money or whatever it takes to stop them.

200
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:37,902
I'll take care of it.

201
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,402
Even still.

202
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,541
How could you use someone from our agency?

203
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,142
I really thought Se Yeon was a school bully.

204
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,242
There were comments online that he changed his name...

205
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,152
after going to the juvenile detention center...

206
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,581
when he was in middle school.

207
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,012
We checked the facts,

208
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,652
but it turned out the bullies were behind it.

209
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,551
I found out Se Yeon was framed...

210
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,492
when I read about it in the article.

211
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,661
Then you should've told me when you found out!

212
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,531
How could you keep it from me?

213
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,032
Se Yeon was dead by then.

214
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,402
What was the point?

215
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:15,441
And whether or not it was true, words were spreading,

216
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,211
so it was bound to get out eventually.

217
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:20,382
What's wrong with speeding it up?

218
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,822
Shut your mouth. He committed suicide because of it.

219
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,822
Don't you get it yet?

220
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,521
And then what? You plagiarized his song?

221
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,661
How could you steal a dead kid's song?

222
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,941
Soo Ho.

223
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,082
Soo Ho!

224
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,021
How badly were you hurt?

225
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,721
I'm sorry.

226
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:06,991
It's because I got mad.

227
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:10,862
I'm sorry. Wake up. Please.

228
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,741
Who are you?

229
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,125
Who are you?

230
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:36,804
- Who are you? - Sis!

231
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,774
Soo Ho!

232
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,074
Sis?

233
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:46,784
You have a sister?

234
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,185
A cousin who's like a sister.

235
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:55,754
When did you come?

236
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,895
What? I... I just got here.

237
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:12,004
Don't cry. I'm fine.

238
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,544
It's not serious.

239
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,145
Sis.

240
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:18,915
I'm glad.

241
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:22,244
I kept calling, but you wouldn't pick up.

242
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,784
I thought you were badly hurt.

243
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:27,024
I lost my phone in the accident.

244
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,885
I see.

245
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,725
You must be very close to your cousin.

246
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,195
She was bawling just because of a little cast.

247
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,635
We're very close.

248
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,834
I'll let you rest.

249
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,334
You're leaving already?

250
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,145
He's right. You came all this way. You should stay longer...

251
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,744
Sis.

252
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,885
No. I'll go now.

253
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:58,984
Sis?

254
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:03,225
Oh my gosh.

255
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,425
(A General Ward)

256
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:09,425
What's going on? He was in the accident with Seo Jun?

257
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,294
How did they...

258
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,034
It looked like he broke his leg.

259
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:18,074
Should I just sneak a peek at his face?

260
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,044
No, no. I should...

261
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,975
Why are you sitting on a patient?

262
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:29,145
- Sorry. - Wait.

263
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,885
Stay like this for a minute.

264
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:44,094
I missed you like crazy.

265
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,774
You're hurt.

266
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,334
It's okay.

267
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:58,675
I feel fine now that I saw you.

268
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:11,895
I really am okay.

269
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,195
Where did this punk go?

270
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:24,375
Whatever. I don't care whether or not you get your shot.

271
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,205
I don't care if you're in pain.

272
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,155
Sorry for getting mad at you.

273
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:44,594
I'm sorry too.

274
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,425
I won't do it again.

275
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:50,094
- Forgive me. - I won't do it again either.

276
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,195
Forgive me.

277
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,334
What happened, though? How did you get into an accident?

278
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,405
Ju Kyung.

279
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:05,744
What do I do?

280
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,155
Se Yeon...

281
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:30,705
Your girl will be mine for sure!

282
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,975
Too slow.

283
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,244
What you heard didn't come from my mouth.

284
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:46,915
Where were you at this hour?

285
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:50,554
What on earth?

286
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,294
What a sap.

287
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:16,615
Sleep tight. I'll come by tomorrow too.

288
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:22,284
Right. He lost his phone.

289
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:34,605
Close the window, will you?

290
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,205
Close it.

291
00:23:47,145 --> 00:23:48,514
Talk about being unlucky.

292
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,594
Why did you run into the street?

293
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,024
You ended up injured too.

294
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:05,594
It wasn't because of you, you know.

295
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:13,334
Your father thinks I'm Leo.

296
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:17,375
How can they do this after first planning a memorial album?

297
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:22,984
What did you tell your father when you bought all those instruments?

298
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:26,385
This wouldn't have happened had you told him sooner.

299
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:29,455
Don't you find this unfair?

300
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:37,965
You had a reporter publish an article...

301
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,334
about Se Yeon being a bully in school...

302
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:41,365
to prevent this photo of you and the actress from becoming an issue.

303
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,105
But how could you even steal his song...

304
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:44,334
to cover up your mistake?

305
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,415
Ju Kyung.

306
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:04,524
Hey, Soo Jin. Did you sleep well?

307
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,524
What are you, a robot?

308
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:09,465
Why are you being awkward?

309
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:11,794
Was I? I didn't mean to be.

310
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:12,834
Please don't, okay?

311
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,234
I'd hate for things to be awkward between us.

312
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,804
I see you tied your hair back today.

313
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,435
Me too. Look.

314
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,475
It's pretty.

315
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:23,544
Let's go.

316
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:28,145
Could we perhaps push up the study session to today?

317
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,784
I have an extra class lined up for tomorrow.

318
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:33,385
- But Soo Ho... - What about him?

319
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:38,054
Soo Ho won't make it today as he's in the hospital.

320
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,824
What? When?

321
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:43,294
He and Seo Jun were in a car accident yesterday.

322
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,935
And you're telling me this now?

323
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:46,665
What?

324
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:52,004
Well, I only found out last night.

325
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,905
Is he badly hurt? Where did the accident occur?

326
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,685
Forget it. I'll just ask him myself.

327
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,685
You should head in. I need to turn in my homework.

328
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:05,254
Sure.

329
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,205
I brought you some clean underwear.

330
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:30,375
How are you feeling?

331
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:38,385
If you need extra help, I'll hire a caregiver...

332
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:39,484
I don't need one.

333
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:42,584
I'd rather you not come back here.

334
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:45,455
Soo Ho, what you heard yesterday...

335
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,225
Seo Jun, Mom's here.

336
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:50,324
My gosh. Hello.

337
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:54,534
Yes, hello.

338
00:26:57,804 --> 00:26:59,074
We'll talk some other time.

339
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:16,455
- Mr. Han. - Got it.

340
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,125
- Soo Jin. - Yes?

341
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,425
I'm sorry to ask, but can you help...

342
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:20,994
- sort out everyone's notebooks? - Sure.

343
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:24,195
All right, new girl. Head up to your class.

344
00:27:24,264 --> 00:27:27,764
The class leader will show you to your seat.

345
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,605
- Yes, sir. - Good.

346
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:35,405
Mr. Han, didn't a student of yours transfer from Yongpa High School?

347
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:38,514
Ju Kyung? Yes, she's from Yongpa High.

348
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:41,915
I don't get why they'd transfer to a neighboring school.

349
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:48,554
I did hear that students there weren't exactly the nicest.

350
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,754
Sir, come on.

351
00:27:51,024 --> 00:27:53,024
I'm sure the kids have their own reasons.

352
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,405
- No, the meat. - Just eat what I give you.

353
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:12,274
- There you go. Look at my baby eat. - I'm not a baby.

354
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,084
This just reminds me of how I fed you when you were young.

355
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:18,254
When did Mr. Trickle get so big, right?

356
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,584
Soo Ho, did you know...

357
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,594
that Seo Jun's nickname used to be Mr. Trickle?

358
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:27,925
- Mr. Trickle? - Yes, we called him that because...

359
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,195
he couldn't stop wetting his bed at night.

360
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,465
Why would you tell him that?

361
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:33,935
You did so until you were about 10.

362
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:37,605
No, you wet your bed once or twice in fifth grade as well.

363
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,135
Stop it, Mom.

364
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,544
As if there's anything to be embarrassed by.

365
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,715
You're close enough to even go to the sauna together.

366
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,915
How were you two involved in the same accident though?

367
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,584
You rarely spend time together now as if you've had a falling out.

368
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:57,425
Even when you came to visit me in the hospital,

369
00:28:57,554 --> 00:28:59,925
you told me not to tell Seo Jun.

370
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,994
I found it odd back then too.

371
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,234
That's not the case.

372
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,494
So how's your health?

373
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,165
Good. It's why I've been out and about.

374
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,304
- Don't you have a job to get to? - All right, fine.

375
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,804
Go ahead and have this.

376
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:15,804
Come on. That's it.

377
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,945
Are you done? I'll clear these then.

378
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,484
Are you done as well? I'll clear the plate for you.

379
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:27,925
I'm all right.

380
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:30,895
You can stick to helping Mr. Trickle.

381
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,455
Hey!

382
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,234
I can still use my legs, you know.

383
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:51,744
- What's with you? - What do you mean?

384
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,084
- Is there an issue? - No.

385
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,685
Fine, then.

386
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:58,685
Lee Soo Ho.

387
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:02,125
Forget it.

388
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,195
I can't hold it in anymore!

389
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:07,564
- Hold what in? - I need to pee.

390
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,324
Mr. Trickle strikes again.

391
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:12,465
Why are you telling me that?

392
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:15,365
- Who else can I tell? - The nurse.

393
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:17,774
How can I tell the nurse to lower my pants?

394
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,705
Yes, I'd like to change rooms.

395
00:30:22,145 --> 00:30:24,145
- Are there any vacancies? - Hey!

396
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,794
Darling, from what I hear, Soo Ho and Seo Jun...

397
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:49,665
were injured in a fistfight and not a car accident.

398
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,004
- Really? - Yes.

399
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:52,804
It's weird how they got injured together,

400
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:54,074
so that's what the rumors say.

401
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:55,405
Who do you think won?

402
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:56,975
It was a car accident.

403
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:57,975
My sister saw it as it happened...

404
00:30:57,975 --> 00:30:59,375
in front of the building where she works.

405
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:03,145
Are you sure it wasn't a fistfight in front of that building?

406
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:04,615
Not at all.

407
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:07,185
Shouldn't we visit Soo Ho at the hospital?

408
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,425
Should we? Why don't we all go tomorrow?

409
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:11,355
I'm late for my part-time job. I'll get going.

410
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,925
- Bye, Jjoo! - Work hard, Ju Kyung.

411
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:18,094
Lim Ju Kyung?

412
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:21,834
- Come on. - Don't I know it.

413
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:22,935
What on earth?

414
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:24,504
Hi.

415
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,435
- Hi. - Hi.

416
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:29,544
- I'm... - Hi. Who might you girls be?

417
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,544
- She's talking to me, you know. - Hold on a second.

418
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:36,514
Well, this is embarrassing to ask, but...

419
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:38,514
- Ask me what? - Your number!

420
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:41,385
- Congratulations. - It's 010...

421
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,625
Do you know Han Seo Jun?

422
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:44,824
Han Seo Jun?

423
00:31:45,294 --> 00:31:46,625
He's absent from school today.

424
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,294
We've been waiting at the school gate, you see.

425
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,725
- To be honest, Seo Jun... - Hey, Joo Hye Min!

426
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:53,435
Is it seriously that cow?

427
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,234
- Hey... - Let's step back.

428
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,534
- What on earth? - What's going on?

429
00:31:57,705 --> 00:32:00,105
- What are they doing? - What now?

430
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:01,304
Wait for me!

431
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:03,574
I see you transferred to Saebom High.

432
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,675
You switched schools after reporting us as bullies...

433
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,584
only to land here of all places?

434
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,945
Stupid cow.

435
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,984
We were suspended from school thanks to you.

436
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,425
- Why you... - No, leave her be.

437
00:32:16,425 --> 00:32:19,725
Hye Min, do you want us to stop bullying you?

438
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,494
Answer me, you brat.

439
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:28,135
If you do what I ask, we'll stop bothering you.

440
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:30,705
Can you do that for me?

441
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:33,675
Yes.

442
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:36,605
There's a girl named Lim Ju Kyung at your school.

443
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,385
- Ju Kyung? - She has the same name as Dumpling.

444
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:45,185
I want you to find out if she's really dating Han Seo Jun.

445
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:48,425
Aren't you going to answer me?

446
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:51,195
Okay, I will.

447
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:54,425
Okay, good. Keep me updated.

448
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:57,494
You know what will happen if you ignore my texts, right?

449
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,645
Soo Ho.

450
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,045
Hey.

451
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:19,514
Are you here on a blind date?

452
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:23,324
How did you get in an accident? You should've been more careful.

453
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:24,824
You didn't have to come.

454
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:26,895
I came because I was worried.

455
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:31,165
It's an air-purifying plant. You don't need to water it often.

456
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,404
I heard you refused to get help from a caregiver.

457
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:37,634
Your dad asked me to take care of you,

458
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,275
so I brought some stuff that you might need.

459
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:43,074
I brought a facial cleanser and toner.

460
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,014
I also brought you your laptop.

461
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:50,114
- Thanks. - No problem.

462
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:53,114
Thank you, Seo Jun.

463
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:55,755
I heard you got hurt while trying to save Soo Ho.

464
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:58,694
Why are you thanking me? You're not his girlfriend.

465
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:00,654
If you're going to be so grumpy about it, then I'll take it back.

466
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,694
Do you have to wear a cast for a long time?

467
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,565
You don't need to get surgery on your leg, right?

468
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:10,065
It's okay.

469
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,304
Did they only have a double room?

470
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,444
Should I ask your dad to move you to another hospital?

471
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:18,875
No, I'm good. Here.

472
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:22,415
- Thanks. - Shouldn't you be at your academy?

473
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:25,514
I still have time. Why are you trying to make me leave so quickly?

474
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:27,824
- You're so mean. - Why did you come by yourself?

475
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:29,685
Where's Ju Kyung?

476
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:31,494
What?

477
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:32,725
Aren't you guys best friends?

478
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:33,755
You always do things together,

479
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,025
so why didn't you bring her with you?

480
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:37,264
She had a part-time job today.

481
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:40,895
Why? Were you waiting for her to come?

482
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:44,134
Why are you asking me? You should ask him.

483
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:51,275
Why should I ask him? Aren't you the one dating Ju Kyung?

484
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:54,014
- That's what our classmates think. - What?

485
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,074
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

486
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,145
May I take your order?

487
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,444
Strawberries and grapefruit?

488
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:32,085
You must really like refreshing drinks.

489
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:34,014
The taste of refreshing drinks makes you feel nice.

490
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,895
It's just like you, Joon Woo.

491
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:40,625
How so?

492
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:50,165
Because you're refreshing just like grapefruit. Grapefruit.

493
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:53,775
Stop it. You can't call me Grapefruit.

494
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,904
Why not? Isn't it normal for couples to make nicknames for each other?

495
00:35:57,444 --> 00:35:58,574
Right, Grapefruit?

496
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:00,944
Stop it, Strawberry.

497
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:02,744
See? It's weird.

498
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:08,384
Hee Kyung, why didn't you go to work today?

499
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:13,255
I had a reality check after I yelled at my boss, so I took the day off.

500
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,964
Should I just quit before I get fired?

501
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:17,864
Joon Woo.

502
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,364
Ju Kyung. Ju Kyung.

503
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:24,875
- Ju Kyung. - What? What's the matter?

504
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:26,404
Joon Woo.

505
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:37,444
Are you that appalled about Ju Kyung finding out?

506
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:40,985
I just feel a bit uneasy about it because I'm her teacher.

507
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,884
If she finds out,

508
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,824
she won't be able to think of me as her homeroom teacher.

509
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:49,565
And if the other kids find out, they'll think I favored her...

510
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,395
every time I give her good grades on her school work.

511
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:53,735
Okay, I get it.

512
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:55,904
Let's keep it a secret.

513
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,304
Thank you.

514
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:04,875
But why is she working part-time?

515
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,844
Why is she making money in secret?

516
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:11,415
She should be studying right now.

517
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:12,915
It looks like Ju Kyung has...

518
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,855
a dream of her own.

519
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,824
She wrote on the desired career sheet...

520
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:19,025
that she wants to become a makeup artist.

521
00:37:19,594 --> 00:37:20,594
Didn't you know?

522
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:21,994
"A makeup artist"?

523
00:37:26,235 --> 00:37:28,264
What are you doing?

524
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:30,665
Hey, Mom. Punch me.

525
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,935
Punch you? Why?

526
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:35,005
Because I have dynamic visual acuity.

527
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:38,375
Right. Left. Right. Left.

528
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:42,415
- Mom! - Dynamic visual acuity, my foot.

529
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,614
Just go to the hospital for me.

530
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,815
- The hospital? - Soo Ho got hospitalized.

531
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,085
He doesn't have a mom to cook for him,

532
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:49,824
and you get sick of hospital food after a while.

533
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,494
It's beef bone soup. Make sure you give it to him.

534
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:54,665
How did he end up getting hurt?

535
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:55,924
But I'm busy right now.

536
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:59,264
- Tell Dad to go instead. - He went to the culture center.

537
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:01,134
Go deliver it right now.

538
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:08,705
(Saebom Culture Center)

539
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,444
Hey, we're going to drink tea together.

540
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:14,545
Would you like to join us?

541
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:18,485
Thank you for the invite, but I need to cook dinner.

542
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:22,384
- What a family man. - He's so kind.

543
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,355
I know a place that sells delicious coffee.

544
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:26,455
- Really? - If you come here...

545
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,565
to get your eyelashes and eyebrows done,

546
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:30,025
you'll get coffee for free.

547
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,634
- We'll be there. - Yes, of course.

548
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:33,665
- We'll see you next class. - See you next time.

549
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,534
- Bye. - Goodbye.

550
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,475
- I'm sorry. - My gosh.

551
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,145
Columbus Park?

552
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:54,315
Hey! Stop!

553
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:56,685
Hey! Stop right there!

554
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:03,264
Hey! Stop! Where do you think you're going?

555
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:06,464
Where do you think you're going? Hey! Wait! Columbus...

556
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:13,074
Sir, please follow that car.

557
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:21,214
Seo Jun's probably here too.

558
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:24,485
Why did I have to come with no makeup on yesterday?

559
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:26,784
I need a mirror.

560
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:33,525
Is that good enough?

561
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:36,094
(Lee S Ho, Han S Jun)

562
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:40,264
- Why don't you do it yourself? - Will you please do it properly?

563
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,505
I'll come back later.

564
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,174
Hey, guys.

565
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:56,944
Hey, you're here.

566
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:59,284
You guys look very close.

567
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,924
I was helping him get changed.

568
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:06,225
- Should I wait outside? - Will you hurry up?

569
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,625
I'll hurry up and get him dressed.

570
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:22,304
Are you going to the bathroom?

571
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,145
Do you need my help?

572
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,415
You help him with that?

573
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:30,714
I... I guess you can't go by yourself.

574
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:34,784
Don't imagine it in your head. I'm off to take a walk.

575
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,134
I brought this because I thought you might be bored.

576
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,634
It looks heavy. You didn't have to bring anything.

577
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:54,875
It looks fun.

578
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:00,645
I'll get it for you.

579
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,384
- Wait. Let me untangle it for you. - Wait.

580
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,625
Sorry. Just a second.

581
00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:13,424
- Wait. - My hair...

582
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,494
Hey, what...

583
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,435
This is from my mom.

584
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:26,875
I'll be off now. You guys can continue what you were doing.

585
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,304
- It's not what you think. - My hair's stuck...

586
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,415
Go ahead and kiss.

587
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:34,844
I'll kill you if you tell Mom.

588
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,384
- What are we going to do? - Just a second.

589
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:39,855
Sorry. Can you move to the right?

590
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:43,324
- I'm sorry. - What does Seo Jun like?

591
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:44,784
He loves chicken.

592
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:49,194
What are we going to do?

593
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:50,665
What are we going to do?

594
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,014
- Get in. - Hold on.

595
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,523
- Seo Jun! - We're here!

596
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:03,893
- He isn't here. - Where is he?

597
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,163
- Soo Ho! Soo Ho! - Darn it.

598
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:08,964
- Soo Ho! - Seriously.

599
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,793
- Soo Ho! - Stop!

600
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,103
- Don't touch me. - Why not?

601
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,203
- It hurts. - It hurts?

602
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,804
- It hurts? - He's hurting.

603
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,273
Soo Ho!

604
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,944
- Don't touch him! - Oh no.

605
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:21,574
Just how bad is it?

606
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,214
Am I dreaming?

607
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:27,683
- Whatever. - Hold on.

608
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:29,813
What are you doing here? Are you sick?

609
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,853
- I am not. - Thank goodness.

610
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:35,424
Wait. Hold on. Don't you want to know why I'm here?

611
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:37,623
Don't you wonder if I'm sick or something?

612
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:38,793
Not at all.

613
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,793
What's wrong? Are you really sick?

614
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:46,864
I'm sick. I have a disease.

615
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,804
- A disease? - It's terrible. Incurable.

616
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:51,674
There are so many symptoms.

617
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:53,574
My brain can only think about Go Woon.

618
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:55,643
My eyes can only see Go Woon.

619
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,373
My heart can only beat for Go Woon.

620
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:01,683
My feet can only run to Go Woon!

621
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:03,913
- Oh my gosh. - Seo Jun.

622
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:05,253
You're so sick.

623
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:06,953
- What? - You poor thing.

624
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,094
but if it's incurable, you'll die. Because I'll kill you.

625
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:16,194
- I will! - Two.

626
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,194
leave Go Woon alone.

627
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:20,404
How dare you hit on my baby sister?

628
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:21,733
She says she isn't interested!

629
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,233
I'll make her interested!

630
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:26,474
- One! - I will!

631
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:27,543
Two!

632
00:43:28,444 --> 00:43:30,313
keep liking Go Woon.

633
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:31,444
Why you...

634
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,483
I will keep liking Go Woon.

635
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:36,514
See you again, brother.

636
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:38,453
Stop right there!

637
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,884
He's such a freak.

638
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,494
Here. Your underwear. Underwear.

639
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:49,094
Does Ju Kyung know too?

640
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,293
That her brother likes you?

641
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:53,464
What? He's Ju Kyung's brother?

642
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:55,773
Yes. There.

643
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:57,603
Is that it?

644
00:43:58,304 --> 00:43:59,404
Yes.

645
00:44:01,444 --> 00:44:02,974
It's good.

646
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,014
Try some.

647
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:07,983
Seo Jun!

648
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:10,714
- You're alive. - Come here.

649
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,054
- Come here. - What are you doing?

650
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,554
Hey, Seo Jun! Are you okay?

651
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:17,494
- That hurts. - It hurts?

652
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,893
Seo Jun! You look good in a hospital gown.

653
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:23,194
That injury is like a medal of honor.

654
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,563
- You're awesome. - Awesome.

655
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,534
I was worried sick about you!

656
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:29,404
- I had no appetite. - Seriously.

657
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:32,944
Hey! You had no appetite because you never stop eating.

658
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:34,304
Gosh.

659
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,543
Excuse me!

660
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:37,773
Can you guys keep it down?

661
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:39,614
Don't you see that sign?

662
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:40,813
You're not alone here.

663
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:42,953
I'm thirsty. Do you have anything to drink?

664
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,324
Aloe...

665
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:53,464
Sorry. I'll fix it.

666
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,364
What is this?

667
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:57,933
Give that back.

668
00:44:57,933 --> 00:45:00,364
Look! It's underwear!

669
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,703
- What? - Give me a break.

670
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,373
- So fancy! - So fancy!

671
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:04,534
Give them back.

672
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,404
Get out! Get out of my way.

673
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:10,214
Poor Soo Ho. You need your rest.

674
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:12,214
Look at him. He's sweating.

675
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:15,784
- Oh no! Oh no! - What do I do about this?

676
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:17,583
- My hands are fine. - Really?

677
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,224
Then I'll wipe your feet since they're not fine.

678
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:21,623
Stop!

679
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:23,753
Your foot!

680
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:32,663
It's small and cute.

681
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,304
I didn't know you liked pink.

682
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:36,804
How dare you touch it!

683
00:45:37,974 --> 00:45:41,873
Hey! I just wanted to wipe your feet for you...

684
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:43,674
No need to yell.

685
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:46,413
You're so mean.

686
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,784
Darn it.

687
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,324
You're so mean to me.

688
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,753
- Hey. Let's order chicken. - Where's the TV?

689
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,994
- Hey. Order pizza too. - Where should we order from?

690
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:01,833
- Get what Seo Jun likes. - He doesn't like pizza.

691
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,833
- Spicy? Soy sauce? - Can I help you with anything?

692
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,804
Hey, guys. Leave. All of you.

693
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:11,034
Why? I'm sleeping here tonight.

694
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,603
We have to nurse you through the night!

695
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,674
We're friends!

696
00:46:13,844 --> 00:46:15,643
- Loyalty! - Loyalty!

697
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:17,913
Where would you sleep? Think of your size.

698
00:46:17,913 --> 00:46:19,714
Yes, yes. Leave already. You're so loud.

699
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:20,944
You leave too. Please.

700
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,784
Soo Ho! You're hurting my feelings!

701
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,014
I'll go now.

702
00:46:25,154 --> 00:46:26,324
- What? - Let's go.

703
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:28,724
- Why? - Let's go.

704
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,023
Yes. Go. Let's go.

705
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:34,424
Hey. Why are you so desperate to get rid of us?

706
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,694
For goodness’ sake!

707
00:46:36,464 --> 00:46:39,864
- I want to be alone with Soo Ho. - Alone?

708
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:42,233
Okay. I'm for this bromance.

709
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:43,574
- Me too. - Me too.

710
00:46:43,974 --> 00:46:46,503
- You liked Soo Ho? - Really?

711
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:51,313
That's right. Yeo Ha Jin is shooting a drama in the lobby.

712
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:54,514
- What? Yeo Ha Jin? - Everyone's first love, Yeo Ha Jin?

713
00:46:56,953 --> 00:46:58,214
Sorry, Soo Ho!

714
00:46:58,784 --> 00:47:00,623
- See you later! - Take care!

715
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:01,683
Bye.

716
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:04,023
- Yeo Ha Jin! - Hurry.

717
00:47:05,764 --> 00:47:07,424
Sorry, Seo Jun.

718
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,853
Oh my gosh.

719
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:37,953
Why did you leave?

720
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,023
I got rid of the guys for you.

721
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,293
I... It's too late.

722
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,534
Why did you bother hiding?

723
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,804
Just tell everyone you're dating. Problem solved.

724
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,233
No. I can't do that yet.

725
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,304
Why not? Because of Soo Jin?

726
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:54,744
I told you that was just hypothetical.

727
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:56,773
You're so silly.

728
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,913
Hey. What is that on your hair?

729
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:00,813
Sorry.

730
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:04,284
Darn it. It ripped off.

731
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:07,123
What did you do in bed that his button fell off?

732
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:11,393
You must be imagining that because you're lonely.

733
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:12,764
The kids were joking!

734
00:48:13,464 --> 00:48:14,694
Then I'm going to write on it too.

735
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:16,634
Come here.

736
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:19,634
Don't write anything weird.

737
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:24,804
All done.

738
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:27,143
Later.

739
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,313
(Tiger energy boost. Roar!)

740
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:32,284
Tiger energy boost. Roar!

741
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:34,183
That's right. Seo Jun.

742
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:36,583
Roar!

743
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:42,224
She's milking it.

744
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:46,364
(Pandora Shop)

745
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:50,893
You should've gotten the touch up long ago.

746
00:48:50,893 --> 00:48:52,603
It'll last a while now.

747
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,333
- Thank you. - Let me see.

748
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,744
- Are you done? - It came out nicely.

749
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:02,744
- Lady Hong. - Are you going to the store?

750
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:05,413
No. I came to check on my possession.

751
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:07,083
Your possession? What?

752
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:10,714
I... I will get going now.

753
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:13,523
You're not closed yet, are you?

754
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:14,983
- Hello. - My gosh.

755
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,464
You had a young, handsome client.

756
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:22,063
I'll go now.

757
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:24,293
He's Ju Kyung's homeroom teacher.

758
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:28,163
- Hello. - You were always so polite.

759
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:30,574
You seemed like a teacher.

760
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:32,273
Are you married?

761
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:34,404
No, not yet.

762
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,244
How providential.

763
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,373
My daughter is single.

764
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:42,214
You two would be perfect together. Would you like to meet her?

765
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:45,924
I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested.

766
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:47,784
I'll go now.

767
00:49:48,023 --> 00:49:49,654
Why not?

768
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,824
If things work out, you can have our pork trotters...

769
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:54,023
- for free forever. - Pork trotters.

770
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:57,163
Who would get married just for pork trotters?

771
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:59,464
- You should like each other. - Right.

772
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,404
- Bye, Mr. Han. - Good night.

773
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:05,844
Find a guy for Hee Kyung instead.

774
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:07,373
Do you know anyone good?

775
00:50:07,944 --> 00:50:09,273
Should I?

776
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,444
What kind of guys do you like?

777
00:50:11,614 --> 00:50:12,784
Just say the word.

778
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,654
What kind of guys do I like?

779
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,154
Someone born early in the year 1990?

780
00:50:19,824 --> 00:50:22,594
Someone with no eyebrows, who looks cute with his hair down...

781
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:24,224
and sexy with it up.

782
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:26,424
Someone who seems modest and well-behaved,

783
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:28,694
but like a kitten when he whines...

784
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,694
and drives me crazy. That's the kind of guy I like.

785
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,933
Just say you don't want to meet anyone. No guy is like that.

786
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,773
- Yes, there is. There is one... - She has lost her mind.

787
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,703
I have to go to the convenience store. Bye.

788
00:50:41,203 --> 00:50:43,543
That little... Hurry home!

789
00:50:45,214 --> 00:50:47,784
Joon Woo. Where are you going?

790
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,683
Why do you keep running away? You're driving me crazy.

791
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:57,224
This is your neighborhood. What if Ju Kyung sees us?

792
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,023
She won't walk this way.

793
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:00,893
Really?

794
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:05,464
- Do you like pork trotters? - What?

795
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:07,503
Who said you could smile at just anyone?

796
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:09,904
- When did I do that? - Everyone wants you...

797
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:12,203
because of your pretty smile.

798
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:15,003
That's only in your eyes.

799
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:17,143
Those are some pretty eyebrows.

800
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,983
You're way prettier.

801
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:21,714
Chin down.

802
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:29,623
Hee Kyung?

803
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:32,123
My eyes!

804
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:34,264
Who were you kissing? Your boyfriend?

805
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:35,494
Just go home.

806
00:51:35,494 --> 00:51:37,393
Hold on. Who is it?

807
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:40,003
- Let go of me. - Leave!

808
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,503
Let go!

809
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:44,904
Wait. Is it someone I know?

810
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,574
Of course not.

811
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,273
What's with my sisters today?

812
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,413
I caught both of them with their boyfriends.

813
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:53,284
Just get going, will you?

814
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:55,114
Where were you today?

815
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:58,313
(Mind your head.)

816
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:05,393
What...

817
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:09,634
How many zeros is this?

818
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:11,764
Honey!

819
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,163
I found him!

820
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:16,103
- Found who? - Columbus Park.

821
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:19,003
Our eyes locked as I was leaving the culture center.

822
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,203
- So to catch him... - You took a cab?

823
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:24,543
Exactly! I took a cab and tailed him.

824
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:26,014
You see it in movies, right?

825
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:30,853
"Stop right there, Columbus Park! Sir, step on it!"

826
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:32,483
So, did you catch him?

827
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:35,123
I lost him, of course. But honey,

828
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:38,353
I was able to confirm that he's in Seoul.

829
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:39,364
What good does that do...

830
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,264
when you spent over that much money on the cab ride?

831
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:42,733
- Honey, hold on. - You...

832
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,764
- Wait a second. - Unbelievable.

833
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:47,364
But I was able to confirm that he's in Seoul.

834
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,974
What about the money for the cab ride then?

835
00:52:54,373 --> 00:52:57,174
Be honest with me. Are you studying makeup?

836
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,614
- How did you know? - As if that's important.

837
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:02,453
Is this to avoid other academic subjects?

838
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:05,284
Of course not. I'm serious about this.

839
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,523
It's what I want to do.

840
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,953
I haven't been able to take any proper classes yet.

841
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,924
Is that why you're working part-time?

842
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:14,494
How did you know that?

843
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:19,833
Why else would you be getting home so late?

844
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:22,603
No way.

845
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,373
That's perceptive of you.

846
00:53:25,003 --> 00:53:27,074
Don't tell Mom yet though.

847
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:29,873
I'm going to seek her approval...

848
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,784
once my grades have gone up. I'll get going then.

849
00:53:36,054 --> 00:53:39,253
Ju Kyung, I could pay for the makeup classes.

850
00:53:39,654 --> 00:53:41,753
No, I'd like to try this on my own first.

851
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,893
Look at you all grown up.

852
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:45,554
- I'll get going then. - Sure.

853
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,893
Ju Kyung, let me know if you need any help.

854
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,063
Sure thing, sis. I love you!

855
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,514
Wait. Joon Woo's girlfriend...

856
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,974
is Ju Kyung's sister?

857
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:19,563
Hello, Mr. Han.

858
00:54:19,893 --> 00:54:22,393
Ju Kyung, here you go.

859
00:54:22,694 --> 00:54:25,634
I love strawberries, you know. Thank you.

860
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,964
- Have a good day today. - Thank you for this.

861
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:37,714
Good morning.

862
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:39,543
You're being too obvious.

863
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,444
About what?

864
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:43,884
You're obviously being nice to her...

865
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:46,123
because she's your girlfriend's sister.

866
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:49,494
What?

867
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,253
I don't quite follow...

868
00:54:54,994 --> 00:54:56,034
I don't know.

869
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:59,003
I'm not one to show these things.

870
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,974
When both...

871
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:07,203
sheet A and sheet B are on the coordinate plane,

872
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:11,444
the curve of the upper boundary line...

873
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:16,014
will be shown as Y equals F of X.

874
00:55:17,353 --> 00:55:19,424
- The lower curve... - I hope he's all right.

875
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:23,224
What could he be up to?

876
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:34,464
The area between these two curves...

877
00:55:36,474 --> 00:55:38,534
will be the same.

878
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,313
Here.

879
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,643
I want some meat.

880
00:55:49,253 --> 00:55:50,554
Yours look delicious.

881
00:55:55,654 --> 00:55:57,353
Can you not spill, Mr. Trickle?

882
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:11,373
Okay, stop.

883
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,904
Move back a little. Okay.

884
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:17,174
- Take a right. - Unbelievable.

885
00:56:20,183 --> 00:56:21,643
You carry this around?

886
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:25,583
- Unbelievable. - For my online followers,

887
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,483
every selfie should be taken in the best way.

888
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:32,464
You look great. Check out her skin.

889
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:33,924
- It sure is different. - It actually works.

890
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:38,534
- That's your best one to date. - You look great.

891
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:40,634
I'm entering this into the Newstagram Queen Contest.

892
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,373
- You should enter too. - No, I'm good.

893
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:45,974
She's right. You should take one too.

894
00:56:45,974 --> 00:56:47,804
- All you need is right here. - Right.

895
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,313
I'll pour my heart and soul into your photo.

896
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:54,683
Here we go. Ju Kyung, 1, 2, 3.

897
00:56:55,543 --> 00:56:56,683
Hold up the light reflector.

898
00:56:58,313 --> 00:56:59,353
Stay still.

899
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:01,884
You look amazing.

900
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:04,123
How is this not an angel?

901
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:11,264
What is this? Why are you taking her photos?

902
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,674
Oh, nothing. My hand just slipped.

903
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,074
- Carry on. - Got it.

904
00:57:20,744 --> 00:57:22,873
Over here. And snap.

905
00:57:23,313 --> 00:57:25,844
Gosh, you look pretty.

906
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:28,344
Why don't you look into the air?

907
00:57:31,054 --> 00:57:32,353
Please press down.

908
00:57:35,183 --> 00:57:36,793
I'll soon get you a new one.

909
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,494
Soo Ho.

910
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:48,304
I told you not to come.

911
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,433
We should talk, okay?

912
00:57:54,643 --> 00:57:56,313
It's like I finally got my life back.

913
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:57,773
Hey.

914
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:00,114
You're back here again?

915
00:58:00,384 --> 00:58:02,344
You just can't stay away, can you?

916
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,554
What choice do I have when I can't call him?

917
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:07,183
Talk about devotion.

918
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:09,654
One of your casts is gone.

919
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,663
I got another X-ray and the doctor said it'd be all right.

920
00:58:13,094 --> 00:58:16,194
I'm glad. Soo Ho should get better soon too.

921
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,933
Hey. Did you know that...

922
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:21,733
- he has an older female cousin? - What?

923
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,003
Yes. Yes, of course.

924
00:58:39,054 --> 00:58:41,824
Why did you do it? Se Yeon was my friend.

925
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,594
Why on earth did you do it?

926
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:51,194
I didn't know about Se Yeon's incident.

927
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:55,304
I let Director Oh take care of it,

928
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:58,503
but I had no idea what he'd do.

929
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,503
I would've stopped him had I known.

930
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:03,344
Like you just said, Se Yeon was your friend,

931
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,714
so why would I have done it?

932
00:59:05,744 --> 00:59:07,444
So you're blaming it all on Director Oh.

933
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,784
He did it to cover up your romance with the actress.

934
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:17,623
Saying that you didn't know makes it all right?

935
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:22,424
Do you honestly think you're not responsible?

936
00:59:24,964 --> 00:59:26,264
I...

937
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,603
wasn't able to answer Se Yeon's last call.

938
00:59:32,674 --> 00:59:35,304
Thinking that it led to his suicide...

939
00:59:37,913 --> 00:59:40,384
has been haunting me all this time.

940
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:43,154
But...

941
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:46,583
you were the reason why this happened.

942
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:49,953
Why be afraid of some rumor with an actress?

943
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:51,853
As if it's any big deal.

944
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:54,494
I...

945
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,464
didn't want you to be disappointed in me.

946
00:59:59,534 --> 01:00:02,503
You were already so distant, and I was afraid that the news...

947
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:04,634
will only drive you away.

948
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:06,974
It's why I wanted to cover it up.

949
01:00:09,203 --> 01:00:11,974
How can I be disappointed in a man I have no expectations for?

950
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:15,344
I already witnessed it...

951
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:18,913
a long time ago.

952
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,953
What you were doing on the night Mom died.

953
01:00:37,074 --> 01:00:38,233
What?

954
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:41,904
You saw that?

955
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:45,444
- Soo Ho, back then... - Leave.

956
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,884
Soo Ho. Soo Ho!

957
01:00:49,214 --> 01:00:50,453
Get out!

958
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:55,384
Soo Ho. Soo Ho...

959
01:00:55,424 --> 01:00:57,154
- Soo Ho! - Soo Ho!

960
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,523
- Soo Ho! - Soo Ho, hold it together.

961
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,523
Soo Ho, what's wrong?

962
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:03,034
- Soo Ho! - Mr. Lee?

963
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:05,594
- Soo Ho, what's wrong? - Mr. Lee, are you all right?

964
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:08,103
Soo Ho, stay with me!

965
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:10,873
He seems to have had a panic attack.

966
01:01:11,103 --> 01:01:13,574
The ECG and other tests showed no abnormalities.

967
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,304
It was probably a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure.

968
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:19,043
If this happened quite often, he should receive counseling...

969
01:01:19,214 --> 01:01:20,714
from a psychiatrist.

970
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,534
I always knew he could be frustrating,

971
01:01:45,273 --> 01:01:47,873
but I didn't know he was suffering psychologically.

972
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:52,174
I don't think he'll ever tell you this,

973
01:01:54,784 --> 01:01:57,853
but Leo is actually Soo Ho.

974
01:02:01,654 --> 01:02:02,824
What?

975
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:04,953
You can tell just by going over to his house.

976
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,224
Are you really his father?

977
01:02:09,364 --> 01:02:10,864
I bet you have no idea how happy he was...

978
01:02:11,634 --> 01:02:13,864
every time he made songs with Se Yeon.

979
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:30,913
(Get well soon.)

980
01:03:53,804 --> 01:03:57,534
You see, I like Soo Ho.

981
01:03:58,233 --> 01:03:59,674
It hurts.

982
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:56,264
Leo is actually Soo Ho.

983
01:04:58,534 --> 01:05:00,333
I bet you have no idea how happy he was...

984
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,563
every time he made songs with Se Yeon.

985
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,353
What you were doing on the night Mom died.

986
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:39,974
I wasn't able to answer Se Yeon's last call.

987
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:43,944
Thinking that it led to his suicide...

988
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:47,384
has been haunting me all this time.

989
01:05:58,623 --> 01:06:00,824
How long will you take it out on me?

990
01:06:01,364 --> 01:06:02,724
Until you meet Se Yeon...

991
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:05,663
in the afterlife.

992
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:10,203
Don't forget...

993
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:13,174
that you killed Se Yeon...

994
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,944
and that you have no right to be happy.

995
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:30,493
He's sleeping like a log.

996
01:06:38,863 --> 01:06:40,333
Is he even breathing?

997
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:55,243
Why are you pretending to sleep? I already saw you.

998
01:07:01,323 --> 01:07:04,193
- What do you want? - I want to get some air.

999
01:07:05,224 --> 01:07:06,524
But I don't have a wheelchair.

1000
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:08,594
Just sleep. It's too late for that.

1001
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,594
My gosh.

1002
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,774
Will you hold on properly?

1003
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:24,714
You have a tiny face, but you're so heavy.

1004
01:07:24,714 --> 01:07:25,873
Will you be quiet?

1005
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:29,783
Soo Ho, you just wait until you're able to walk again.

1006
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:32,753
My gosh.

1007
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:36,594
- Use your strength, Mr. Trickle. - I am.

1008
01:07:39,094 --> 01:07:40,594
What are you doing?

1009
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:41,924
I didn't have a wheelchair.

1010
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:44,234
You could've called and asked for one.

1011
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:45,464
Wait here for a moment.

1012
01:07:47,703 --> 01:07:50,033
Why didn't you call a nurse?

1013
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:52,104
Why didn't you just bring one? You can walk just fine.

1014
01:07:52,104 --> 01:07:54,573
- I didn't think of that. - Neither did I.

1015
01:07:54,573 --> 01:07:55,804
You get the top grades in our year.

1016
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:57,743
- Why didn't you use your brain? - How are your grades?

1017
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:15,293
Why...

1018
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,833
didn't you tell me...

1019
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,464
that you never got to meet Se Yeon?

1020
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,804
Up until now,

1021
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:29,243
I thought Se Yeon died because you didn't believe him.

1022
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,373
That's why I kept...

1023
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:34,443
You should've told me.

1024
01:08:34,884 --> 01:08:35,984
Even if I told you,

1025
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:39,714
it wouldn't have brought him back to life.

1026
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,724
I felt guilty for his death.

1027
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,033
If I answered his call,

1028
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:58,403
he might not have died.

1029
01:09:02,943 --> 01:09:04,113
Is that...

1030
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:07,583
what you've been thinking all these years?

1031
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:13,424
You frustrating punk.

1032
01:09:25,193 --> 01:09:28,403
Ju Young, come out and eat some fruit.

1033
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:31,804
Where did Ju Kyung go? It's the weekend.

1034
01:09:31,804 --> 01:09:33,474
Didn't she leave early in the morning?

1035
01:09:33,474 --> 01:09:35,543
- Work. - What?

1036
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:38,974
I said it's none of my business.

1037
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,844
You should show some interest in your sister.

1038
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:44,554
Lee Joo Hun, the CEO of Move Entertainment,

1039
01:09:44,753 --> 01:09:48,323
announced that Black Soul's title song was plagiarized...

1040
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:51,253
and declared to resign from his agency and retire.

1041
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,823
- He's going to retire? - Lee Joo Hun announced...

1042
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,293
- Hello? - that the song was actually...

1043
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:58,363
- Did you see the news? - written by Jeong Se Yeon...

1044
01:09:58,764 --> 01:10:00,064
Lee Joo Hun is apparently going to retire.

1045
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:01,464
Joo Hun!

1046
01:10:01,634 --> 01:10:04,134
Why? Why? My goodness!

1047
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:07,804
No!

1048
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:10,743
Joo Hun!

1049
01:10:10,743 --> 01:10:15,083
Let's define the two dots between the graph as A and B.

1050
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:18,153
The function value of A becomes F of A.

1051
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:20,354
And the function value of B becomes F of B.

1052
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:21,623
Now here's the limit.

1053
01:10:21,623 --> 01:10:22,854
The moment you calculate...

1054
01:10:22,854 --> 01:10:25,094
Soo Jin, this is big news. Did you read the article?

1055
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:30,064
If you connect B with A,

1056
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:33,863
the line declines like this and eventually...

1057
01:10:36,873 --> 01:10:37,974
Soo Jin.

1058
01:10:46,844 --> 01:10:49,243
(Lee Joo Hun confesses the truth behind Jeong Se Yeon's death)

1059
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:05,564
Soo Ho.

1060
01:11:16,174 --> 01:11:17,443
It's you again.

1061
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:19,743
Yes.

1062
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:28,583
It's me again.

1063
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:31,453
I wanted to see you,

1064
01:11:35,594 --> 01:11:36,793
and here you are.

1065
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:41,234
I came to give you a hug.

1066
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:40,524
(True Beauty)

1067
01:13:40,524 --> 01:13:43,123
I poured out everything that had built up,

1068
01:13:43,123 --> 01:13:44,323
but it's still heavy.

1069
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:47,693
Tell them if you can't sleep at night.

1070
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,634
All your sad thoughts, worries, and everything.

1071
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,903
It's Ju Kyung. She's my girlfriend.

1072
01:13:54,503 --> 01:13:58,373
How does it feel to turn the world of social media upside down?

1073
01:13:58,804 --> 01:14:00,144
Ju Kyung!

1074
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:02,003
She transferred from Yongpa.

1075
01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:05,243
There was a girl named Lim Ju Kyung in my old school too.

1076
01:14:05,743 --> 01:14:08,283
Are you really the same Soo Jin that I know?

1077
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:17,193
(He)

1078
01:14:19,394 --> 01:14:20,764
(Hunts)

1079
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:23,793
(People)

1080
01:14:25,434 --> 01:14:28,264
He may still be hunting somewhere even now.

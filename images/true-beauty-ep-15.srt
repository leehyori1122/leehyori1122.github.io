00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,548
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:47,078
I'm here.

3
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,118
Dad.

4
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,688
What?

5
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,129
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,668
I'm sorry, Soo Ho.

7
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,799
I thought I'd never get the chance...

8
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,139
to tell you that.

9
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:21,808
It's all right.

10
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,318
Dad, you should eat.

11
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,118
Here.

12
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,028
I promised...

13
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,799
to buy you something delicious.

14
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:20,169
You can once you've fully recovered.

15
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:27,878
Buy me something delicious.

16
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,819
(Alarm: 3am)

17
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,118
(Boarding Pass)

18
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,789
(Girlfriend)

19
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,329
Weren't you asleep? It's after midnight there.

20
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,398
I was studying, of course. It'll soon be our senior year.

21
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,598
- Are you at the airport? - Not yet.

22
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,209
I'll go once I see my father get discharged from the hospital.

23
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,938
Will he be returning to Korea too?

24
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,838
No, I'll be returning first.

25
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,579
He shouldn't travel long distances yet,

26
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,148
so he decided to take it easy for a while.

27
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,348
I see.

28
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,789
Anyway, it's been a month since we saw each other.

29
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,688
You're right.

30
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:17,428
I missed you.

31
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,558
- I'll meet you at the airport. - Don't.

32
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,928
I'll head to you as soon as my plane lands.

33
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,838
I'll see you tomorrow... No, I'll see you later.

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,039
Sure.

35
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,799
(Intensive Care Unit)

36
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,299
(Operation Room)

37
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,199
Dad?

38
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,269
Dad!

39
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,438
Dad!

40
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:06,278
There was secondary bleeding in his brain,

41
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:08,308
so I had to perform emergency surgery.

42
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:11,848
The location of the bleeding isn't as ideal as it was last time,

43
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:14,519
but we're doing our best.

44
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:36,209
(Operating Room)

45
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,639
Your father had a cardiac arrest during the operation.

46
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,038
Fortunately, his life was never at risk.

47
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,608
His vitals are stable, but his condition is still serious.

48
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,348
(Arrivals)

49
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,209
- The divine Tae Hoon. - The mighty Hyun Kyu.

50
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,968
- Here's to another good year. - Likewise.

51
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:48,639
You're better looking...

52
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,548
Ju Kyung, are you in this class too?

53
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,278
- Talk about a deja vu. - I know.

54
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,218
Here's to another good year together.

55
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,389
- 1, 2, 3, go. - Go!

56
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,788
- I'm Yoo Tae Hoon. - And I'm Ahn Hyun Kyu.

57
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,418
Jjoo!

58
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,629
- You're here. - Hey.

59
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,598
I heard that Soo Jin dropped out of school during the break.

60
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,069
What? For real?

61
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,769
Rumor has it that she went to study abroad.

62
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,538
Are you all right though?

63
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,209
Did Soo Ho tell you when he'd be back?

64
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,218
No, not yet.

65
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,918
Why am I shivering?

66
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,298
How is he?

67
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,838
He's still unwell.

68
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:52,509
Did you get some sleep?

69
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,819
Ju Kyung, aren't you going to school?

70
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,288
- My stomach. - Ju Kyung!

71
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,648
What's wrong?

72
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,858
My goodness, what's the matter? Where does it hurt?

73
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,259
- My stomach. - Your stomach?

74
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,259
My goodness gracious.

75
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,898
Oh, dear. My goodness.

76
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,228
Does it hurt a lot?

77
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,309
(Girlfriend)

78
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,449
(Boyfriend)

79
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,528
Hey, Soo Ho.

80
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,028
Hello, ma'am.

81
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,329
Hello. Have you been well?

82
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,699
Yes, I guess.

83
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:24,569
But why didn't Ju Kyung pick up?

84
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,798
She's sick, so she's at the hospital right now.

85
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,769
She's sick? What's wrong with her?

86
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,738
Don't get startled. It's nothing to worry about.

87
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,038
She had an upset stomach.

88
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,238
She's a senior now, so she's been busy studying.

89
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,638
I think that caused her to get a little stressed.

90
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:39,279
Can she talk on the phone right now?

91
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,079
I'm sorry. She's asleep.

92
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,088
By the way, how's your father?

93
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:47,988
He's still not doing very well.

94
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:52,258
You must be having a hard time as well.

95
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:55,159
I'll tell Ju Kyung to call as soon as she wakes up.

96
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:58,399
Okay.

97
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,358
Hey, Soo Ho.

98
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,529
I feel like we haven't talked in ages.

99
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,228
I know, right? Is everything okay?

100
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,039
Yes, everything's okay.

101
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,669
Actually, I have something to tell you.

102
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,838
I finally got my license.

103
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,209
Good job.

104
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,638
I know, right?

105
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:46,248
- Ju Kyung. - Yes?

106
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:49,819
I think we should...

107
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,088
break up.

108
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:55,819
What?

109
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,858
I don't know when my dad's going to wake up.

110
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,799
And I'm sure it's hard for you to wait for me until I return.

111
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,169
What are you talking about?

112
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,978
I'm totally fine.

113
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,878
I can wait. I'm fine.

114
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,378
I just feel so bad.

115
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,018
I'm can't be there for you.

116
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,858
And that makes me feel so sorry.

117
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:30,459
So...

118
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,199
Who says you need to feel sorry?

119
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,959
I told you I'm fine. Why are you overreacting?

120
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,098
I don't want to break up.

121
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,738
You can even stay there forever. I'll save up and visit you instead.

122
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,008
I can't let you do that.

123
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,079
Why not?

124
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,118
Don't skip school.

125
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,358
Don't wait for me to call you anymore.

126
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,299
And sleep well.

127
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,069
Don't say that. Please don't.

128
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,738
Don't talk as if this is going to be our last phone call.

129
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,909
I'm going to pretend like I didn't hear anything.

130
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:21,608
I never picked up, okay?

131
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:27,309
(Prince Comics)

132
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,848
(Prince Comics)

133
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:33,518
Mr. Prince.

134
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,478
Hey, Ju Bal.

135
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,718
Why are you throwing the chair out?

136
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:40,319
They're too old, so I'm going to change them.

137
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,059
Come inside.

138
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,608
Ta-da! I bought these with the money I earned.

139
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,049
They're a matching set.

140
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:43,588
Cute, right?

141
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,709
I'm not a crybaby. I'm Lee Soo Ho.

142
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,118
When will you finally remember me?

143
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:21,319
On the first day of snow, I'm going to go to Namsan...

144
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,189
and make a wish hoping that you'll remember me.

145
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,029
What?

146
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,569
You should've told me.

147
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,468
How was I supposed to know when you didn't tell me?

148
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:08,199
You know how they say your wish comes true on the first day of snow?

149
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,968
That means everyone who sees the first snow should be happy.

150
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,378
But why are there so many unhappy people in this world?

151
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,579
My dad still doesn't have a job.

152
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,179
I can't believe you believe that.

153
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:19,748
I'm sure they say that for a reason.

154
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,718
I thought about it long and hard.

155
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:25,049
I think the only person whose wish comes true...

156
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,358
is the very first person that the snow hits.

157
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,659
That's nonsense.

158
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,258
So when it snows for the very first time this year,

159
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,659
I'm going to go to the highest place...

160
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,529
and be the first one to touch the snow.

161
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,929
The highest place? Where?

162
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,439
- Are you going to get on a plane... - I'm going to go to Namsan.

163
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,799
What?

164
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,939
Isn't that the highest place in Seoul?

165
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:45,709
Let's say you're right.

166
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:46,809
You just wait and see.

167
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,478
If my wish comes true, you'll find out I was right.

168
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,159
(I'm not a crybaby. I'm Lee Soo Ho.)

169
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,659
(When will you finally remember me?)

170
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,959
(On the first day of snow, I'm going to go to Namsan...)

171
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,858
(and make a wish hoping that you'll remember me.)

172
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:15,238
I can't believe he remembered everything I said.

173
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:20,179
(On the first day of snow, I'm going to go to Namsan...)

174
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,809
(and make a wish hoping that you'll remember me.)

175
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,478
Why does he have to be so smart?

176
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:43,128
(College Scholastic Ability Test)

177
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,238
I took the CSAT today.

178
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,679
If I do well in the practical section,

179
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,379
I may be able to go to the college I want.

180
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:37,248
So this is how it feels to get closer to my dream.

181
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,258
I'm excited and happy.

182
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,189
Did you start studying music there?

183
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:48,929
Someday,

184
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:51,399
somewhere,

185
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:55,339
it'll be nice to hear music that you create.

186
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:03,339
I kept texting you to whine about how hard things were,

187
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,149
but now that the CSAT is over, I've lost that excuse.

188
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,959
Soo Ho. It's snowing here.

189
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:19,129
I hope it's warm...

190
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,998
and not cold where you are.

191
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:32,169
I won't contact you anymore.

192
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,349
Goodbye.

193
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,024
Okay. Smile, Chen.

194
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,593
You're so pretty.

195
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,833
- Nice. - Look at her.

196
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,504
Fix your hair a little.

197
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,133
You look so pretty.

198
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,404
Nice.

199
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,204
Please touch up her hair and makeup.

200
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:02,944
Here.

201
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,043
- Mouthwash. - Okay.

202
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:15,524
Mist.

203
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:19,494
- I'll spray it. - Okay.

204
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,133
Hey, Ju Kyung. When will you...

205
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,803
introduce me to Seo Jun?

206
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,214
He's a trainee, so he's too busy...

207
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:36,543
to meet anyone.

208
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,214
Don't you see him more often at the agency?

209
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,014
There are just so many times I can hit on him.

210
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,154
It hurts my pride too much.

211
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,454
I hear you're close friends. Let me meet with him alone.

212
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,764
- Ask him now while we're at it. - Now?

213
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:54,793
- Now? - Yes. Please? Please.

214
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,593
I'm begging you. Please?

215
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:58,133
Hold on. Just a minute.

216
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,174
She begs every time I see her.

217
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:06,603
Meet with her just once. Please? I'll treat you to a barbecue.

218
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:08,274
No, no. It's too annoying.

219
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,914
All you have to do is eat one meal with her.

220
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:12,944
Ju Kyung.

221
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,553
What did Seo Jun say?

222
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,883
Well... He must be busy. He isn't responding.

223
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,664
No. I detest her type.

224
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,164
- Oh no. - What's wrong?

225
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:33,904
- Oh no! - This is a designer dress.

226
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,633
- This was borrowed. - Oh no.

227
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,303
- You should've been careful. - No, I...

228
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,944
I know.

229
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,974
I told you to make sure not to get anything on the dress!

230
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:44,484
Seriously. What do we do?

231
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,783
I'm sorry. Sorry.

232
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:49,954
You can't pay for this even if you work for a year.

233
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,484
What will you do?

234
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,053
- It won't come out. - Oh no.

235
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:59,694
Ju Kyung. Talk to Seo Jun for me,

236
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:01,164
okay?

237
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,833
It's okay. It's okay, guys.

238
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:07,674
I'll talk to my agency about it. Just let me change.

239
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,603
- It feels icky. - Thank you.

240
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,043
- What an angel. - Let's go.

241
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:12,643
Don't scold her too much.

242
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,014
It's so icky.

243
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,843
Icky.

244
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,313
Cheers!

245
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,724
Cheers!

246
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,484
- Saebom High! - Yes!

247
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:29,994
Why doesn't she just seduce him if she likes him?

248
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:33,494
Why is she bugging me so much?

249
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,494
You said she's a witch, so a staff member quits every month.

250
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,563
If Seo Jun would just go on one date with Chen,

251
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:40,873
it would make your work life easier.

252
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:42,333
Why can't he do that for you?

253
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,373
I can't force him against his will. That's wrong.

254
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,014
But it's so hard for me.

255
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:52,083
Hey. Why did you call us out today?

256
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,454
I'm supposed to watch a movie with my Mini Me.

257
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,024
Isn't that right, wifey?

258
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,353
"Isn't that right, wifey?"

259
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:01,024
Yes, hubby.

260
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,654
Must you do that in front of your single friends?

261
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,424
What's wrong? Did the girl you were seeing dump you again?

262
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,724
I was not!

263
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,734
What? Are you happy that I'm single?

264
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,664
Are you not over me after dumping me?

265
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,303
Whatever. Dream on.

266
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,204
Listen! The reason I called all of you here today...

267
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,843
is to make a big announcement.

268
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:24,944
- What is it? - What the...

269
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,714
- So... - What is that?

270
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,224
Hyun Kyu and I are going to the army next month.

271
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,823
- What? - What?

272
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:34,793
- Where? - When?

273
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:37,464
We're going to enter together side by side. So please...

274
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:39,563
support us.

275
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,393
- Salute! - Salute!

276
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,464
Salute!

277
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,404
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,004
I didn't enlist.

279
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:49,873
I got a girlfriend.

280
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:51,204
- No way! - Oh my gosh.

281
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,414
A girl has taken ownership of my heart recently.

282
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,883
Regardless, I can't join the army.

283
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,414
I'm stunned. Of all the... I'm stunned.

284
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,454
You traitor! We agreed to join together!

285
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,224
- Hey! - Hey.

286
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:09,494
How can I leave my girlfriend as soon as I finally get one?

287
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:12,264
Give me a break. I knew it when I saw you didn't cut your hair.

288
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,863
- Get over here! Get me scissors! - Hey!

289
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:16,164
Stop it, Tae Hoon!

290
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:18,664
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it.

291
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:22,073
Seriously. Look how much you fight. Why would you go together?

292
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,944
Let's drink. Cheers.

293
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,974
Shut it, all of you!

294
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:30,043
Shut it, all of you.

295
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:33,684
Ju Kyung's passed out.

296
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,414
Are you sleeping, Ju Kyung?

297
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:37,623
Is he coming?

298
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:40,024
Why isn't he here yet? He should take care of her.

299
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,524
Here he is. Over here!

300
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:50,764
Hey. Who made Ju Kyung drink?

301
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,063
She drank on her own.

302
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,934
- Don't blame us. - Whatever.

303
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:55,573
- Let's drink. - Ju Kyung.

304
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:57,944
Hey, Ju Kyung. I'm here.

305
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,514
Okay? Wake up.

306
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:07,754
You're here.

307
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:28,373
- Seo Jun. - Yes?

308
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:33,373
You're dead!

309
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:36,214
Chen keeps bugging me because of you.

310
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,244
Hey. Stop it.

311
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:40,714
You'll knock over the drinks.

312
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:41,914
Stop it.

313
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,783
You're dead.

314
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,984
Pour some for her.

315
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,424
- Drink! - Stop it!

316
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:49,593
- I don't see you! - Hey. Hey.

317
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,793
Calm down.

318
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,063
Knock knock.

319
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,593
Knock knock. I want to go home.

320
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,234
- She's drunk. - She's wasted.

321
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:58,633
- You're drunk too. - Hey.

322
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:02,033
- You're kind of cute. - Ju Kyung.

323
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,474
Come on.

324
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,143
I'll take her home. You guys go without us.

325
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:10,583
- Okay. Bye. - Thanks. See you.

326
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,783
Come after.

327
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,543
- Let's go. - Where should we go?

328
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,283
Hey. Just get on my back.

329
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,823
No. I'm not drunk. I can walk.

330
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,954
Fine. Get over here. Come on.

331
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,154
I'm walking well.

332
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:23,623
- Wait. - I'm walking.

333
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,664
Get on my back. Get on.

334
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:29,363
Look. Small octopus. Hey, octopus.

335
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,533
Go to the ocean with me.

336
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,603
- Go to the ocean with me. - Hey.

337
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,204
I'll free you.

338
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,873
What are you doing?

339
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,073
- People eat that, you know. - I'm sorry, sir.

340
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:41,143
Taxi. Taxi!

341
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:42,974
Drive me home, please.

342
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,083
Where did she go?

343
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,744
- Let's go home. - What do you think you're doing?

344
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:48,313
- Let's go! - Miss...

345
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,154
I apologize for this. Ju Kyung, let's go.

346
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:51,853
Ju Kyung, come on.

347
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,954
- Let's go home. - Come here.

348
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:57,893
Hey, you are making me feel sick.

349
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,994
Have you snapped out of it?

350
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:06,404
If you have, you wouldn't have acted that way.

351
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:08,734
Grabbing a live small octopus out of the tank?

352
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:15,014
My stomach feels queasy from the way you carried me.

353
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:17,174
Then just throw it all up.

354
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,684
No, that'd be a waste.

355
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,484
I'm going to digest it all.

356
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:24,424
It'll all go down once I sit for a while.

357
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:26,883
You know how it is. I'm fine now.

358
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:29,623
Seo Jun.

359
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,934
Han Seo Jun.

360
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,303
What now?

361
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,303
Can you please meet with Chen just once?

362
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:44,504
I already declined.

363
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:47,944
Can't you make my life easier just this once?

364
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:50,073
Just agree to a meal with her.

365
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,744
Could you go on a date with someone you don't like?

366
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,484
I'm not asking you to be her boyfriend.

367
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,514
That's enough.

368
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,883
Just meet her this one time!

369
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:00,583
Stop telling me to meet other women...

370
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:02,754
because it annoys me to bits.

371
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:06,464
- Why's that? - Why?

372
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,593
Isn't it about time you knew how I felt?

373
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,154
My head...

374
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,734
Ju Young, pass me some water.

375
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,704
Cut back on the drinking, will you?

376
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,204
You're worse than Hee Kyung.

377
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,274
What?

378
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:56,073
Where did you just kick?

379
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,113
Did you sleep over last night?

380
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,684
How could I send him home...

381
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:03,154
when he carried you home hair wet from all the sweating?

382
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,623
Must you embarrass me in front of him?

383
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:07,654
Is that so?

384
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,424
I don't remember anything after I left the bar.

385
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,393
I completely blacked out.

386
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,934
You must be so proud.

387
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,803
I hear Seo Jun will make his debut soon.

388
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,274
Yes, we agreed on a concept...

389
00:28:21,274 --> 00:28:22,734
and all we need to do is decide on a lead single.

390
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,803
Nice.

391
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,744
You can hand that over without washing it.

392
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,543
Once you make it big,

393
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,583
I'll sell it online as the clothes you wore.

394
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,313
Unbelievable.

395
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,783
Will we not get to see you often...

396
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,424
once you become a top celebrity?

397
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:39,984
Nonsense. I'll come by every day.

398
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,293
To see Ju Kyung?

399
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:46,893
No, to eat the food you make.

400
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,004
How is it better than what my mom makes?

401
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:53,734
I was known to be good at everything other than studying.

402
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,774
If you want, I can pack you some young radish kimchi.

403
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:56,873
Some?

404
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,004
I'd like a lot, please.

405
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:02,244
Sure. Eat up and I'll pack some for you.

406
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:13,924
It's for you to eat at your dorm.

407
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,424
Work hard and take care.

408
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:16,454
Ju Kyung.

409
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,863
- What? - About yesterday.

410
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,734
What about yesterday?

411
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,333
You really don't remember anything from when we left the bar?

412
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:29,633
No, I don't.

413
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,174
Did I behave indecently in any way?

414
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,373
You really don't remember?

415
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,714
Of course, I don't. Why would I lie to you?

416
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:37,343
Stop pretending that you don't remember.

417
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,984
This isn't me pretending. I don't remember a thing.

418
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,083
We kissed.

419
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,073
Let's go.

420
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,214
Hop on.

421
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:14,654
Let's go.

422
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,714
Let's go home.

423
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,484
Ms. Hong will be waiting for me.

424
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,393
Let's go.

425
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,563
Hey. We didn't kiss!

426
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,694
How can you know when you don't remember?

427
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,664
What?

428
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:33,103
So you do remember.

429
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:36,373
It's why you've been walking on eggshells around me all morning.

430
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,043
I've known you for years now.

431
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,674
What was I supposed to do?

432
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,174
And what if I do remember?

433
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,214
It'll only make things awkward between us.

434
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,143
You were just drunk and confused...

435
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:47,283
I wasn't confused...

436
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,283
and it wasn't a drunken mistake.

437
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,424
I never dreamed about telling you in this ridiculous way,

438
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:58,623
but you kept bringing Chen up and...

439
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:01,194
What does any of this matter though?

440
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,133
Just forget about it all.

441
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,164
Forget it happened and wait for me.

442
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,904
I'll properly tell you how I feel someday.

443
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:33,694
What on earth? Seo Jun likes me?

444
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:39,004
No way. I bet it's a joke.

445
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,803
Is it April Fool's Day?

446
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,803
It isn't.

447
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:48,613
Then why...

448
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:51,583
Since when?

449
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:07,593
Cho Rong, what do I do?

450
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:11,103
You waited two years to tell her how you feel,

451
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,363
but you finally did so out of anger and at her house...

452
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:14,474
while holding a container full of kimchi...

453
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:16,404
at eight in the morning...

454
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:18,204
looking like that?

455
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:20,643
I never confessed my feelings, all right?

456
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:22,643
I just told her I would someday.

457
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,343
It was like a teaser.

458
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,883
- A teaser? Are you kidding me? - Darn it.

459
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:29,383
Okay, fine. Just don't shed any tears.

460
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:32,724
I've been losing too much muscle to join you on the crying.

461
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:36,893
But maybe this is for the best.

462
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:38,964
If you hadn't gotten angry, Lee Soo Ho...

463
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,063
You would've thought...

464
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:43,133
you were betraying Soo Ho by telling her how you feel.

465
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,904
So it was for the best.

466
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:49,803
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

467
00:32:50,974 --> 00:32:52,103
just keep pushing forward.

468
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,543
How does one confess his feelings?

469
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,444
Don't you watch TV dramas?

470
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,583
The guys you see in them...

471
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,043
rent an amusement park for the day,

472
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,053
have a helicopter fly above her,

473
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:04,214
or take her on a cruise ship...

474
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:06,454
to shoot fireworks into the sky.

475
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:07,994
I'm not rich, you know.

476
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,553
Where would I get the money?

477
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,763
Right. Of course.

478
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:15,734
Then, let your face do all the work.

479
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,734
Anything you do will look cool.

480
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:19,034
Check this out.

481
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:21,203
Fix your eyes with a longing gaze.

482
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:23,933
Once I drink this,

483
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,103
you'll be my girlfriend.

484
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,944
I won you over, didn't I?

485
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:30,473
Try it yourself.

486
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:34,853
Be my girlfriend.

487
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,484
My heart just skipped a beat.

488
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:43,293
My heart's pounding like crazy!

489
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,024
Seo Jun, do just that.

490
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,094
- Really? - She won't be able to refuse you.

491
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:51,734
Will you be my girlfriend?

492
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:53,833
Be my girlfriend.

493
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,804
Be my girlfriend, please.

494
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:59,603
Stop that, okay? My heart's skipping too many beats.

495
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,714
Don't do that either.

496
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:04,074
(Lim Jae Pil)

497
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,984
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.

498
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:10,484
I'm Lim Jae Soon.

499
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:15,623
Hello, I'm Mr. Prince from Prince Comics.

500
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:17,353
I love you.

501
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:20,594
Seriously? You can't be that straightforward.

502
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:22,663
Let's change roles this time.

503
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,103
Hello,

504
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:27,534
- it's good to meet you. - Likewise.

505
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,504
What on earth...

506
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:32,873
- are you doing here though? - What do you mean?

507
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:35,543
A flower should be in a flower garden.

508
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:37,574
What are you up to?

509
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,344
I'm giving him pointers for his blind date tomorrow.

510
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,384
Really?

511
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:44,784
I hope it works out this time and you get to marry next year.

512
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:46,683
- I'll need a willing partner. - And she's out there.

513
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:49,154
She's out there somewhere, so get searching.

514
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:50,924
Take our Hee Kyung for example.

515
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,563
She's always been against marriage,

516
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:54,833
but she met a guy and will get married soon.

517
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:56,793
Just a second.

518
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,263
Jae Pil?

519
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,333
What's up with him?

520
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,603
He gets emotional whenever Hee Kyung's wedding is mentioned.

521
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,513
He must be upset to marry her off.

522
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,714
By the way, don't you get to know if Ju Young got into college today?

523
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:15,953
Yes, but I have no doubt he'll get into one.

524
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:17,484
All right...

525
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:20,824
(2022 Admission Results)

526
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:24,694
- Let's check at the same time. - No way.

527
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,763
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

528
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:27,493
- Nice! - Darn it.

529
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,263
You're up first.

530
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:33,333
Did I get in?

531
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,833
- No way. - Why? Did I not get in?

532
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,004
You got accepted!

533
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,143
Are you serious?

534
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:45,243
Ju Young, let's go out!

535
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,453
Nice! I'm so happy!

536
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,254
It's time to check yours now.

537
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:57,393
What? You didn't get in.

538
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:00,393
Forget what I said. I take it back.

539
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,134
What's with those two?

540
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,703
I thought they were best friends.

541
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:10,134
When did they start liking each other?

542
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,703
Isn't it about time you knew how I felt?

543
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,683
Let's eat dinner together tomorrow.

544
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,893
Don't bother trying to avoid me. Let's meet up and talk.

545
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,623
Forget it happened and wait for me.

546
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,393
I'll properly tell you how I feel someday.

547
00:36:41,973 --> 00:36:43,404
I asked for the point brush.

548
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:45,574
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,743
- Just a second. - Move.

550
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:52,944
Get to your senses.

551
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,083
I don't need you right now, so go wait somewhere else.

552
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:58,984
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,094
You're in the way. Just go.

554
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:09,194
What's the matter with me?

555
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:14,134
Please sign this sheet and make a donation for kids in Africa.

556
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,274
Thank you.

557
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:17,174
Please sign this sheet.

558
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:19,344
Thank you. Please sign this sheet.

559
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,944
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye. Go home safely.

560
00:37:24,313 --> 00:37:25,413
Ju Kyung.

561
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,214
Are you okay?

562
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,853
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

563
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:47,504
All the difficult times I had

564
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:52,873
Melt away like the snow

565
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:56,913
I still hope for

566
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:59,143
- Is there a girl? - He must be seeing someone.

567
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,114
- He's waiting for her text. - No, I'm not.

568
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,024
- Look at him. - See? It's a girl.

569
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:06,953
Okay, sure.

570
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,793
(- Let's eat dinner together. - Okay, sure.)

571
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,163
Let's meet tomorrow after you get off work.

572
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:13,393
(Let's meet tomorrow after you get off work.)

573
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:21,703
See you tomorrow.

574
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,054
I can't believe that beautiful fairy...

575
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:39,924
is going to be my wife.

576
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:41,353
My gosh, you're doing it again.

577
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:45,163
I don't need to wear this, right? And this is a little tight.

578
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:47,563
So get me a size bigger than this. I think I'm done trying on dresses.

579
00:38:47,563 --> 00:38:51,134
Hee Kyung, you should try on more. You can try on three in total.

580
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:53,333
What do you think about trying on the bell line wedding dress?

581
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,074
I think that one will look nice on you.

582
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,873
What matters is that we're getting married.

583
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:58,074
The dress isn't important.

584
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:02,174
You're so easy-going.

585
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:05,913
Then should we let the groom pick out his tuxedo first?

586
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:06,944
Sure.

587
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,223
Hee Kyung.

588
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,203
What do you think?

589
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:28,774
You look great. Let's go with that one.

590
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:31,774
But wasn't the first one better?

591
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:34,574
The first one? This one looks similar.

592
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:37,643
- Tuxedos are all the same. - What are you talking about?

593
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,683
The first one was a black notch lapel tuxedo with a vest.

594
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,784
This one is a deep navy shawl lapel tuxedo...

595
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,824
with a cummerbund.

596
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:47,424
The one I tried on earlier had a straight collar.

597
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,123
But this one is round.

598
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:52,123
Depending on the collar, I could either look sharp or gentle.

599
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,623
It really has a big effect on my impression.

600
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,194
Do you know how important that is on the day of the wedding?

601
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,933
People will comment on whether or not you're marrying a handsome...

602
00:39:57,933 --> 00:40:01,203
You're so handsome that the tuxedo doesn't even stand out.

603
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,074
You're not being serious.

604
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:06,973
Okay, fine. Try on the next one. This time, I'll be extra attentive.

605
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,444
Try on the next tuxedo.

606
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,223
- What do you think? - The tuxedo has found its owner.

607
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:20,683
You're glowing.

608
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:23,424
Really? This one's the same one I wore just a minute ago.

609
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:25,824
I didn't get changed.

610
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:27,924
What? My gosh.

611
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,333
You're lying.

612
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,734
We'll just call it a day.

613
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,904
Honey. Joon Woo. Joon Woo.

614
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:38,004
Honey.

615
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:42,714
Are you upset?

616
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,614
No, why would I be upset?

617
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,513
But it feels like I'm the only one getting married.

618
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:52,183
What are you talking about? You're marrying me.

619
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,824
It just feels like I'm the only one who's excited about the wedding.

620
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:57,694
Okay, fine.

621
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:00,393
I'm sorry, okay?

622
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,094
What are you sorry about?

623
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:05,433
Well...

624
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,663
I'm just sorry about everything.

625
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:11,643
Call me once you realize why you're sorry.

626
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:15,114
Joon Woo. Joon Woo!

627
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:25,054
My gosh, how am I going to make him feel better this time?

628
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,174
Mist.

629
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:50,174
Here.

630
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:55,784
I don't think I can walk. My feet hurt.

631
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,484
Just a second.

632
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:08,734
Here.

633
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,004
Go pick it up.

634
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:15,034
Chen, that's a bit too...

635
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:25,284
Seo Jun.

636
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,984
It's Seo Jun! Hey, Seo Jun!

637
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:33,424
Seo Jun, how did you know my album came in first place?

638
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,353
I can't believe you bought me flowers.

639
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,464
Here.

640
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:46,364
- Hey. - Yes?

641
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:48,004
- Do you have no hands? - Me?

642
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:51,373
Hands? I have hands.

643
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,214
Then go get it yourself.

644
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,813
- Hey. - Yes?

645
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:02,583
She can go home now that her schedule's done, right?

646
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,583
Yes, we're going to go home after we move everything.

647
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:07,183
- You can get off work, Ju Kyung. - No, I'll take everything upstairs.

648
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:09,393
- We'll be off now. - Okay.

649
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:10,524
- See you. - Let's go.

650
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:12,063
But...

651
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:14,964
I'm sorry. I'll be off now. I'll see you tomorrow.

652
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:20,933
Gosh, what's his problem?

653
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:36,353
- Why are you standing there? - What?

654
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:38,884
No, it's nothing.

655
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:45,723
But is it okay to come here dressed like this?

656
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:46,893
You look pretty.

657
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:56,174
You're holding it upside down.

658
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:10,614
- What do you think? - What?

659
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,694
It's delicious. It's nice here.

660
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,063
- Are you nervous? - No.

661
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:20,793
Why would I be nervous?

662
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:25,763
Well, I am.

663
00:44:28,163 --> 00:44:30,234
After I told you how I felt yesterday,

664
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:34,904
I kept trying to come up with a fancy way to ask you out.

665
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,813
But I didn't want to make a fuss like people do in dramas or movies.

666
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:44,154
And I figured this place must be popular for a reason.

667
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:48,054
I'll just be straightforward with you.

668
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:53,864
I like you, Ju Kyung.

669
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:04,504
Seo Jun, I...

670
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,004
I've liked you for a long time.

671
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,074
But back then, I knew you liked someone else.

672
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:13,643
So I never got to ask you out, but I couldn't give up either.

673
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,884
It's been three years since I've felt this way for you.

674
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:19,984
But I can't keep it a secret anymore.

675
00:45:20,953 --> 00:45:23,293
I keep finding myself wanting to tell you like I did yesterday.

676
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:25,594
So I can't hide it.

677
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:27,723
I just can't.

678
00:45:27,864 --> 00:45:29,493
- Seo Jun... - I'm...

679
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:32,534
begging you to see me as a guy,

680
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,163
right now.

681
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:37,804
Sway a little.

682
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:39,674
Just once.

683
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:44,174
I'm not asking for an answer now.

684
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,384
Three dates.

685
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,554
Go on three dates with me.

686
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:52,723
As a guy and a girl.

687
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:06,464
What's wrong?

688
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,404
It's nothing.

689
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,404
Hey, what's wrong?

690
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:15,574
Do you feel sick?

691
00:46:19,784 --> 00:46:21,413
- Here. - Thanks.

692
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:26,254
Gosh. I knew you'd get sick. You were eating so quickly.

693
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:29,094
Do you need medicine?

694
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,123
No. It was just a little indigestion.

695
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,464
Were you that uncomfortable?

696
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,933
No.

697
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,504
This is nice.

698
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,103
Be uncomfortable whenever you see me from now on.

699
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:46,074
I want you to be nervous around me...

700
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:48,913
and very aware of me as I am.

701
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:53,043
But don't get sick.

702
00:47:13,404 --> 00:47:14,404
I'm...

703
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:18,674
begging you to see me as a guy, right now.

704
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:23,214
Sway a little.

705
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:26,043
Just once.

706
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,103
Why did you open this?

707
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:06,183
I really don't have the time to do this right now.

708
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:14,524
My dear brother-in-law. Thank you very much.

709
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,024
Get something to eat with this, my dear brother-in-law.

710
00:49:19,163 --> 00:49:21,594
My dear brother-in-law. Why don't we put a heart...

711
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:23,194
at the end of the candle walkway?

712
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,534
Why don't we brothers-in-law do it together?

713
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:32,203
Where are you going?

714
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,574
To the convenience store.

715
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,944
Help us blow these up.

716
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,583
I'm dizzy. I can't do this any more.

717
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:47,154
- Are you crying? - It's really happening.

718
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,893
Hee Kyung's getting married.

719
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,123
There you go again.

720
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:53,524
Hee Kyung is the one who should cry, not you.

721
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:56,364
No.

722
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:58,433
I should tip her off.

723
00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:01,203
It's a surprise. You can't tell her.

724
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:03,134
Honey.

725
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,243
Hey.

726
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:13,083
Joon Woo is over right now,

727
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,254
setting things up for a surprise proposal.

728
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:17,413
What? A proposal?

729
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,424
That's why he acted like he was upset earlier.

730
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:23,293
He's super excited about making it all moving,

731
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:24,893
so you have to cry.

732
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:26,964
Make yourself cry.

733
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:28,864
I can't force myself to cry.

734
00:50:29,364 --> 00:50:30,594
Fine.

735
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:34,933
Why is he so cute?

736
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,473
How do I make myself cry?

737
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:43,114
Darn it. When was the last time I cried?

738
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,214
Here.

739
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:49,353
(Soju, Beef jerky)

740
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,123
It's the first snowfall already?

741
00:50:52,123 --> 00:50:53,824
It's so annoying when it snows.

742
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:56,353
It's 5.7 dollars.

743
00:51:06,404 --> 00:51:09,504
On the first day of snow, I'm going to go to Namsan...

744
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:12,004
and make a wish hoping that you'll remember me.

745
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:18,913
I love stuff like this.

746
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:23,114
The nightscape looks so pretty.

747
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:09,894
Soo Ho!

748
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:19,303
I'm sorry.

749
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:33,584
My girlfriend likes strawberries.

750
00:52:46,104 --> 00:52:47,164
Hey.

751
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:49,934
Of course, I'm here.

752
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,173
It's cold, so dress warmly.

753
00:53:04,483 --> 00:53:06,823
Maybe I should check my prescription.

754
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:33,943
I can't calm down.

755
00:53:38,454 --> 00:53:41,524
(You're my world and every moment of my life.)

756
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:43,794
I didn't get to say any of this.

757
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:45,894
The flower meaning.

758
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:49,064
I forgot that too.

759
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:55,834
I forgot the flower meaning.

760
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:03,014
Drinking solo is the best.

761
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:07,783
It's snowing a lot.

762
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:34,274
What time is it?

763
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,593
May I see your ticket?

764
00:54:51,653 --> 00:54:52,724
Did I drop it?

765
00:54:53,193 --> 00:54:54,294
Just a second.

766
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:19,483
Found it.

767
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:44,874
(Heart Lock)

768
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:49,914
Ju Kyung?

769
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:01,794
Ju Kyung...

770
00:56:27,883 --> 00:56:29,954
I came over here as soon as I landed...

771
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:36,093
and here you are.

772
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,343
Your face is freezing.

773
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:57,814
You must be cold.

774
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,624
Why are you back?

775
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:10,664
Because I missed you.

776
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,164
But we broke up.

777
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:18,673
So why did you miss me?

778
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,274
Still...

779
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,843
I still missed you.

780
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,253
I missed you so much.

781
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:43,533
I...

782
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:49,434
I haven't missed you at all.

783
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,573
Ju Kyung?

784
00:57:58,244 --> 00:57:59,314
Ju Kyung!

785
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,314
Did you get home safely?

786
00:58:04,153 --> 00:58:06,823
Are you here to practice at this late hour?

787
00:58:07,124 --> 00:58:09,524
Yes, I didn't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

788
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:12,193
Why's that? Are you nervous now that your debut is imminent?

789
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,823
Anyway, keep working hard.

790
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:18,633
By the way, Mr. Kang said that Soo Ho got in today.

791
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:20,334
- What? - Didn't you know?

792
00:58:20,503 --> 00:58:22,834
His father gained consciousness last month.

793
00:58:23,274 --> 00:58:26,503
The doctors called it a miracle. That's great news, right?

794
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,303
Yes, it is.

795
00:58:28,303 --> 00:58:30,514
Anyway, don't exhaust yourself and head home soon. Bye.

796
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:31,744
Sure thing.

797
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,314
Would it have killed you to call?

798
00:58:38,954 --> 00:58:41,483
The person you have reached is not available.

799
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,323
- What on earth? - Ju Kyung.

800
00:58:43,794 --> 00:58:44,894
We should talk.

801
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:47,363
I don't want to see you right now.

802
00:58:49,323 --> 00:58:51,494
Are you hurt? Ju Kyung.

803
00:58:52,064 --> 00:58:53,664
No, just go away.

804
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:56,274
Are you all right?

805
00:58:57,503 --> 00:58:58,573
Let me take you to a doctor.

806
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,693
I don't like seeing you sick.

807
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,834
Why are you still here?

808
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:03,633
I told you to leave me alone.

809
01:00:04,303 --> 01:00:06,774
- How could I? - Just go.

810
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:07,943
I'm not going anywhere.

811
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:10,874
Then I'll leave instead.

812
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:14,383
How are you feeling?

813
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:16,414
I'm all right.

814
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:18,213
- Do you have her test results? - Yes.

815
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:19,783
Is there a serious issue with her?

816
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,454
- Not exactly. - If that's not the case,

817
01:00:22,454 --> 01:00:23,794
why was she in so much pain?

818
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:25,253
What's the reason for it?

819
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,994
- Constipation. - Sorry?

820
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,564
Is that a serious illness?

821
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:33,963
Don't tell me I need surgery.

822
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:35,334
You have infrequent bowel movements.

823
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:38,704
Because of it, you felt temporary pain in your stomach.

824
01:00:39,843 --> 01:00:43,314
The opaque parts on this image...

825
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:44,874
indicate built-up gas and stool.

826
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:47,814
For how long haven't you been able to go?

827
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:51,113
Don't be ridiculous. I poop just fine!

828
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:01,024
Drinking doesn't help with constipation.

829
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,334
Ju Kyung, wait. Ju Kyung!

830
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:11,274
You've got to be kidding me.

831
01:01:17,943 --> 01:01:19,314
What do I do?

832
01:01:27,024 --> 01:01:28,483
You're here with Mr. Lim, right?

833
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,823
Please follow me to the reception desk.

834
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:31,354
Sure.

835
01:01:42,863 --> 01:01:45,003
(My beloved Hee Kyung, will you marry me?)

836
01:01:46,573 --> 01:01:48,374
- I'll turn it on. - Here she comes.

837
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:54,983
The door opens

838
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:58,414
And you enter

839
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:00,823
At a first glance

840
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:05,153
I knew you were my sister-in-law-to-be

841
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:06,764
- Ju Kyung? - Was that Ju Kyung?

842
01:02:06,963 --> 01:02:08,224
Yes, it was.

843
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,434
Just kill me already.

844
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:12,693
Why do I bother to live?

845
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:15,264
Talk about a humiliating reunion.

846
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:19,673
(Restricted Access)

847
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:24,343
My sweet Grapefruit, I'm touched!

848
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:28,044
I'm truly touched.

849
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:32,113
No, this is no good. We'll take it from the top.

850
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:34,624
Hee Kyung, go back outside. You'll make another entrance.

851
01:02:34,724 --> 01:02:36,323
Darn it. But why?

852
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:38,323
- We have to do this again. - Are you kidding me?

853
01:02:38,494 --> 01:02:40,564
- Come on. - Why must we do this?

854
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:45,033
It's all right. We'll just take it from the top.

855
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:46,604
Everything's fine, so take some deep breaths.

856
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,803
It sure isn't easy to get married, is it?

857
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:05,553
- Yes? - I dropped off your luggage.

858
01:03:06,454 --> 01:03:09,124
I can't believe you ran off without heading home first.

859
01:03:36,184 --> 01:03:37,184
Found it.

860
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:48,794
Ju Kyung?

861
01:03:58,303 --> 01:03:59,434
Because it snowed.

862
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,073
I heard it was this year's first.

863
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,474
What? Use the car that's parked out front. It's your dad's.

864
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:08,244
Got it. Thank you for today.

865
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:27,463
(Girlfriend)

866
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:34,803
(Girlfriend)

867
01:04:50,494 --> 01:04:51,693
(Lee Soo Ho)

868
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:04,633
Did you go home safely?

869
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:16,014
(Missed call: Han Seo Jun)

870
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,483
- Seo Jun. - Hey.

871
01:05:24,323 --> 01:05:25,494
How did you know?

872
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:27,064
I heard at the agency.

873
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,693
You're unbelievable.

874
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:30,963
- How could you not call? - I'm sorry.

875
01:05:31,363 --> 01:05:34,133
I came in a rush, so I had a lot to take care of.

876
01:05:34,604 --> 01:05:35,764
Your place hasn't changed at all.

877
01:05:38,503 --> 01:05:40,403
- I only have water. - It's okay.

878
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,303
How's your dad?

879
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:43,943
Is he okay now?

880
01:05:44,113 --> 01:05:45,213
Did he get discharged?

881
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:48,584
He's going to start getting rehabilitation therapy.

882
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:50,383
That's great news.

883
01:05:50,653 --> 01:05:54,024
Hey, you should've visited me the moment you got here.

884
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,053
I can't believe you didn't call.

885
01:05:56,283 --> 01:05:57,423
I kept calling you.

886
01:05:58,093 --> 01:05:59,294
I didn't get a chance to.

887
01:06:00,764 --> 01:06:02,124
I met Ju Kyung.

888
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:08,434
Really? You met her today?

889
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:11,073
Yes. By coincidence.

890
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:20,114
Are you crying?

891
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:22,684
(Woosam Snack)

892
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:23,883
It's just spicy. That's all.

893
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,053
You never had a problem eating spicy food.

894
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:33,053
Are you crying?

895
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:35,093
Did you check your college admission result?

896
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,633
Did you not get in? Is that why?

897
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:42,333
Then why are you crying?

898
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:44,034
Did something happen?

899
01:06:44,303 --> 01:06:45,633
I miss him.

900
01:06:48,574 --> 01:06:50,144
I miss him.

901
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:52,074
My gosh, that punk.

902
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,184
Then call him.

903
01:06:56,184 --> 01:06:57,984
Judging by his personality, he broke up because he felt bad.

904
01:06:58,654 --> 01:06:59,883
Do you want me to call him instead?

905
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:05,953
No. I'm going to get over him now.

906
01:07:07,593 --> 01:07:09,024
I'm almost over him.

907
01:07:11,734 --> 01:07:13,333
What's the matter with me today?

908
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,404
Maybe it's because it's snowing.

909
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:28,583
- Seo Jun. - Yes?

910
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,354
Did you eat? Should I order something?

911
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:31,654
Of course.

912
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:34,154
We haven't met in a while. Give me some updates.

913
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,354
Wait here.

914
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,843
My gosh, what a coincidence.

915
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:04,883
I can't believe I met you here.

916
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:06,514
What's going on?

917
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,394
Where are you going? Where are you going?

918
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:14,264
Don't follow me.

919
01:08:14,364 --> 01:08:16,694
I'm not following you. I need to go this way as well.

920
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:17,993
That's another coincidence.

921
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:20,104
Did you eat breakfast?

922
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:22,904
Let me see your face.

923
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,673
Yesterday was the first day of snow. Why did you go to Namsan?

924
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,873
You thought of me, didn't you?

925
01:08:32,314 --> 01:08:35,343
Ju Kyung, you were right. My wish actually came true.

926
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:37,713
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

927
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,154
Your stomach might hurt again if you run! Ju Kyung!

928
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,154
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

929
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,324
Taxi. Taxi.

930
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:47,963
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

931
01:08:48,364 --> 01:08:50,163
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

932
01:08:54,503 --> 01:08:56,133
He didn't even contact me for an entire year.

933
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,503
What does he want now?

934
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:10,854
Soo Ho.

935
01:09:14,224 --> 01:09:15,883
How did you know about this place?

936
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:17,154
What a coincidence.

937
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,253
Is this where you work?

938
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:20,923
When do you finish work today?

939
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:23,394
Who told you? Was it Ju Young? Tae Hoon?

940
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:24,663
I swear it's just a coincidence.

941
01:09:25,463 --> 01:09:28,133
Are you saying you came to a hair and makeup salon by coincidence?

942
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:30,734
Yes. I came to get my hair done.

943
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,173
Well, good luck getting your hair done.

944
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:35,904
Hey.

945
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:40,543
Is he an actor?

946
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:42,684
- I don't know. He's good-looking. - Excuse me.

947
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,014
Can I please get a drink?

948
01:09:45,284 --> 01:09:47,224
I'm really thirsty.

949
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,024
What are you doing? Go get him a drink.

950
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:51,824
Okay.

951
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:03,333
He's handsome, so you should give him a lot.

952
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:08,173
Soo Ho doesn't like sweets.

953
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:10,913
Gosh, why do I still remember this stuff?

954
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:12,474
Like I care.

955
01:10:23,923 --> 01:10:25,194
Does she not even eat?

956
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,493
You'll be done in 10 minutes.

957
01:10:27,493 --> 01:10:28,564
Already?

958
01:10:28,764 --> 01:10:31,293
Then can you straighten it back?

959
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,534
I changed my mind.

960
01:10:34,003 --> 01:10:35,264
I'll be off now.

961
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,404
You did great, Ju Kyung.

962
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:37,803
- Bye. - Bye.

963
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:43,303
I guess he's gone.

964
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:54,453
Seo Jun?

965
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,724
Hey, you finished early.

966
01:10:56,993 --> 01:10:59,253
- What are you doing here? - Do you have time for me today?

967
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:00,663
What?

968
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:03,633
You promised me three dates. Did you forget already?

969
01:11:05,593 --> 01:11:08,633
Well... Yesterday...

970
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:09,764
You met Soo Ho, right?

971
01:11:10,404 --> 01:11:11,434
You heard?

972
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,444
So what? That doesn't mean we can't hang out.

973
01:11:16,503 --> 01:11:20,144
Today, I only want you to think about me.

974
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:23,883
It's the least you can do to someone who asked you out.

975
01:11:26,184 --> 01:11:27,383
Okay, fine.

976
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:30,493
- What are we going to do? - Just follow my lead.

977
01:11:32,324 --> 01:11:33,553
Whatever.

978
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:35,293
Where are we going?

979
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:55,843
Why do you want to ice-skate all of a sudden?

980
01:11:55,984 --> 01:11:58,913
Guys take girls ice skating when they go on dates.

981
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:01,123
They help them when they're about to fall,

982
01:12:01,123 --> 01:12:03,184
and that gives them a chance to become physically closer.

983
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:06,154
They can ice-skate and enjoy spending time together.

984
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:09,394
I'm not a good ice skater.

985
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:11,093
Neither am I.

986
01:12:12,064 --> 01:12:13,264
- What? - What are we going to do?

987
01:12:16,034 --> 01:12:17,234
Here. Let me do it for you.

988
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:20,644
Let's take a look.

989
01:12:22,444 --> 01:12:23,814
You tied them well.

990
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,293
Hey. Hey, be careful.

991
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:45,663
I thought you weren't good.

992
01:12:46,534 --> 01:12:48,663
Ju Kyung, let's make a bet.

993
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:52,173
The first person to get to that pillar is the winner.

994
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:54,404
- The winner gets to make a wish. - That's so typical of you.

995
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:56,404
Come on. Let's try. Instead, I'll go backward.

996
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,444
Ready?

997
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:01,583
1, 2, 3. Go.

998
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,114
- You're good. - I'm good, right?

999
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:08,354
- Careful. - Okay.

Ju Kyung.

1001
01:13:14,864 --> 01:13:15,923
Ju Kyung.

1002
01:13:17,534 --> 01:13:18,633
Ju Kyung.

1003
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:20,803
Are you okay? Did you get badly hurt?

1004
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:22,104
No, I'm okay.

1005
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:23,663
Let's get you up.

1006
01:13:24,003 --> 01:13:25,434
1, 2, 3.

1007
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:28,404
Is it bad?

1008
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,303
No, it's just a small scratch.

1009
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,644
- Give me that. I'll do it. - Let me see.

1010
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:43,793
I'm sorry.

1011
01:13:46,394 --> 01:13:47,493
I'm sorry.

1012
01:13:50,963 --> 01:13:52,364
It's okay. I'll do it.

1013
01:13:58,104 --> 01:13:59,333
We shouldn't have made a bet.

1014
01:14:00,404 --> 01:14:02,574
Why do you like making bets so much?

1015
01:14:03,703 --> 01:14:04,843
Here. Throw it out for me.

1016
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:08,514
I won, okay?

1017
01:14:38,043 --> 01:14:39,343
I want to look at earrings.

1018
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:40,913
For Go Woon?

1019
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,614
No, for myself.

1020
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:49,724
Which one do you like more?

1021
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:53,253
- I like this one. - This?

1022
01:14:54,663 --> 01:14:55,694
I'll take this.

1023
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:57,993
She'll pay for it. Thanks.

1024
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,394
What?

1025
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:00,934
Hey, Seo Jun.

1026
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,413
It changed a lot.

1027
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,024
(Lim Ju Kyung's spot. Sit without permission, and get a hairy butt!)

1028
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:29,394
After all this, you want to break up? Jerk.

1029
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:30,934
I hope you get constipation.

1030
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:45,314
Where are you?

1031
01:15:46,913 --> 01:15:48,213
I'll wait.

1032
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:49,784
(Where are you? I'll wait.)

1033
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:51,984
You bought me the earring, so I'll pay for this.

1034
01:15:53,184 --> 01:15:54,684
I should've ordered something expensive.

1035
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,324
This is expensive.

1036
01:15:57,354 --> 01:15:58,423
It's good.

1037
01:16:00,253 --> 01:16:02,764
(Where are you? I'll wait.)

1038
01:16:12,074 --> 01:16:14,904
It's too rich. Do you want ice cream?

1039
01:16:15,543 --> 01:16:16,774
- What? - Excuse me.

1040
01:16:16,803 --> 01:16:18,574
- Yes? - Mint ice cream please.

1041
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,784
- Okay. - Make it cold please.

1042
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:21,784
Okay.

1043
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,314
- Make it minty. - Okay.

1045
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,423
You didn't have to walk me home.

1046
01:16:32,694 --> 01:16:35,324
It's because we're a guy and a girl today.

1047
01:16:36,093 --> 01:16:37,663
I wouldn't if we were friends.

1048
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:43,434
You live too close to the station.

1049
01:16:44,503 --> 01:16:47,234
What do you mean? It's so far.

1050
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:49,503
No, it isn't. It's super close.

1051
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:54,114
We're here. Get home safely.

1052
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:57,083
Ju Kyung.

1053
01:16:58,453 --> 01:16:59,614
Yes?

1054
01:17:01,753 --> 01:17:02,784
I'm...

1055
01:17:04,593 --> 01:17:05,654
using my wish.

Those memories don't hurt as much anymore.

01:18:35,684 --> 01:18:36,684
I'm sorry.

1062
01:18:37,614 --> 01:18:39,184
Do you still like Ju Kyung?

1063
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:41,984
No. We're going out.

1064
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:44,793
Hey. It's Ju Kyung.

1065
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:47,053
He's acting weird! He's all limp.

1066
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:48,593
I'm going to start studying.

1067
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:51,064
I want to learn properly from the basics.

1068
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:55,404
Know something? It was my last day.

1069
01:18:57,003 --> 01:18:58,203
Don't go.

1071
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:19,354
When will this hunt end?

1
00:00:07,447 --> 00:00:09,447
(Episode 91)

2
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,820
The address says it's here.

3
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:17,691
People don't seem to live
around here.

4
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,526
Why did they ask me to come here?

5
00:00:58,532 --> 00:00:59,600
Move.

6
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:04,471
Who's up there?

7
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,143
Are you okay?

8
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,181
We should get out of here.

9
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,082
Come on, ma'am.

10
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:19,686
Are you hurt?

11
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,593
No, I think I'm okay.

12
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,188
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,798
You must have sprained your ankle.
I'll call an ambulance.

14
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,611
Hello?

15
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,437
Yes, we're at...

16
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:42,109
Mom!

17
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:44,745
Su Hee, are you all right?

18
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:49,692
I told you it's not a big deal.
You didn't have to come here.

19
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,985
What happened? How did you get hurt?

20
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:55,656
I just sprained my ankle.

21
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:58,134
You should have been careful.

22
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:00,060
Where did you get hurt?

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
But still,

24
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,164
it's fortunate
that it's not serious.

25
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,054
Don't worry, Sang Tae.

26
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,502
I'll be fine after a day or two.

27
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,419
How much...

28
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,521
does Ji Sook remember?

29
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:29,476
It seems she only remembers
Chairman Cha...

30
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,324
after hearing
that she's Seo Ji Sook.

31
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:33,427
If she remembers everything,

32
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,905
she wouldn't be staying still
like now.

33
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,406
If she remembers him,

34
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,533
it's only a matter of time
before she remembers me.

35
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,010
So...

36
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,270
we have to keep her away
from my husband.

37
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,971
Find a way!

38
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:46,773
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:54,758
Mom,

40
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,726
are you sure you'll be okay
by yourself?

41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,095
Oh, I said I'm fine.

42
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,397
You said you even had to
bring work home.

43
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,399
You also have to go to work
early tomorrow.

44
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,423
Go on and head home.

45
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,837
But I'm worried.

46
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,397
Oh, gosh. I'm really fine.

47
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:13,567
Yes, we should go
so that she can get some rest.

48
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,269
If you get sick at night,
call me right away.

49
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,604
I will.

50
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:18,904
Go ahead.

51
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:20,372
Min Hyuk,

52
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:21,884
have a word...

53
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:23,777
with me before you go.

54
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,318
You got your memory back?

55
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,787
Do you remember everything then?

56
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,323
Not everything.

57
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,310
Why are you with Chairman Cha
in these photos?

58
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,314
I was Seo Ji Sook,

59
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,350
and I had been...

60
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,229
dating Woo Seok.

61
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,320
That's what I remembered.

62
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,991
Then...

63
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,927
does Chairman Cha know
your memory returned as well?

64
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,963
Yes. I talked to him in person.

65
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:19,466
And as we were parting,

66
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,768
I got a text message.

67
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,137
A text message?

68
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,736
The person said
he or she will tell me...

69
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,783
the truth of the day
I lost my memory.

70
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,844
So I went to
where they told me to be,

71
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:32,279
but suddenly...

72
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,414
the construction material fell
on my head.

73
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,683
Did you...

74
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:39,252
see who was there?

75
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,053
No.

76
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,291
Please show me the text.

77
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,481
(If you want to know the truth
about that day, come here.)

78
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,307
Wait, this number is...

79
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,976
These are the call records
between Park Sang Chul...

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,512
and Choi Chang Beom in 2015.

81
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,267
The number that's shown
on both their records is...

82
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:09,850
the culprit's burner phone.

83
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,855
Why? Do you recognize this number?

84
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,324
No.

85
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,659
I'll look into it.

86
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:21,794
And Su Hee,

87
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,290
when you get this kind of text
from now on,

88
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,234
remember to tell me.
Don't just go there alone.

89
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,668
Okay?

90
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:30,736
Okay.

91
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,529
Mother, are you just coming home?

92
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,412
Where have you been?

93
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,821
I had some business to take care of
because of the foundation.

94
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,528
I see. Right.

95
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,888
Father's already home.

96
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,891
Is he?

97
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,236
Something good must have
happened to him.

98
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,795
He looked happy.

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,811
Do you remember...

100
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,614
why the floral language
of a viola is...

101
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,152
"eternal love"?

102
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:22,522
You and I...

103
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:25,825
decided to call it that way.

104
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:30,796
Ji Sook.

105
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,847
You came home early today.

106
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:50,250
Yes. Hello.

107
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,520
Did anything good happen?

108
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,755
You look happy.

109
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:57,424
No,

110
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,059
nothing happened.

111
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,039
So...

112
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,642
Su Hee got her memory back, right?

113
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,875
Yes.

114
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,979
But not in its entirety.

115
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,245
Also,

116
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,983
I think that's what injured her
today.

117
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,818
What do you mean by that?

118
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,486
She received a text...

119
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,581
telling her to come
to the construction site...

120
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:29,923
if she wants to know the truth.

121
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,591
And...

122
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,127
that's where she was attacked.

123
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,429
Who on earth sent that text?

124
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,650
It was the same burner phone
from five years ago.

125
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:43,336
It was currently turned off,
so I went to the construction site.

126
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:44,971
But there aren't any cameras...

127
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:46,940
nor any unusual traces.

128
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,577
She could have been
seriously injured.

129
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:53,413
It's lucky her injury isn't
that bad.

130
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,048
Does that mean...

131
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,718
Chairman Cha isn't the one...

132
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,087
who killed my brother
in the hit-and-run?

133
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,057
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

134
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:05,836
Why?

135
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,859
Chairman Cha and we are
the only ones...

136
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,927
who know that Su Hee got
her memory back.

137
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,296
But...

138
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,598
the day her memory returned,

139
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,835
she was attacked instantly.

140
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,438
Then...

141
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:20,407
what should we do now?

142
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:22,284
First, we can't let anyone else
find out...

143
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,710
that her memory has returned.

144
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:26,422
I'll investigate if someone else...

145
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:28,715
other than Chairman Cha or us
knows about it.

146
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:30,482
And...

147
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,652
about Ju Hwa Yeon and Chairman Cha,

148
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,321
we should dig deeper.

149
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:40,060
If I hadn't retired,
this would have been much easier.

150
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Sang Tae,

151
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,170
I'll clear you of your false charge.

152
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:47,510
I've been looking for the owner...

153
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,102
of the bar anyway.

154
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,437
You too?

155
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,740
I looked for the owner too,
but it wasn't easy.

156
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,043
I learned that the owner took
a flight to the Philippines,

157
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,311
but after that,

158
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:00,447
I couldn't find anything else.

159
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,504
I'm still looking,

160
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,097
so please wait.

161
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,907
Thank you for the cellphone.

162
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:29,641
You're welcome.

163
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,578
I'll go to work first.

164
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,312
Okay.

165
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,037
How long does it take to restore
a cellphone that's been reset?

166
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,015
I'll send it to you right now,

167
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,679
so please get it done
as soon as possible.

168
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,139
If this is restored,

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,206
I can put a stop to Yu Ra
who is running amok.

170
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,349
This is Ms. Han Yu Jung's
application form you requested.

171
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:17,706
Thank you.

172
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,806
(Father: Han Dae Chul,
Mother: Yeo Sook Ja)

173
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,340
It was Dae Chul.

174
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:36,949
There you were, Ms. Han.

175
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,406
Hello, Mr. Koo.
Were you looking for me?

176
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,940
Now that I look at you,
you really resemble him.

177
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:45,916
Excuse me?

178
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,649
Your father is Mr. Han Dae Chul,
isn't it?

179
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,849
Do you know my father?

180
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,749
Of course, I do!

181
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,149
I am a very close hometown friend
of his.

182
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,140
I see.

183
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,306
How did you know it was me?

184
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,382
A few days ago, I saw you two
together.

185
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,149
I couldn't get a close look
at the face.

186
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:10,582
Just in case, I checked your
application form. I was right!

187
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:11,906
I see.

188
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:15,332
Dad will be happy if he hears
about you.

189
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,006
It's such a small world.

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,540
By the way, you look very healthy.

191
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,216
Your father was having a hard time
because you had to receive...

192
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,140
heart surgery
not long after you were born.

193
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,216
Now that I see you have grown
so healthily,

194
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,516
I am so glad.

195
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,816
Heart surgery?

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,573
I've never received it.

197
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,506
Sorry?

198
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:40,983
You haven't?

199
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:44,316
You must have been mistaken.

200
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,706
I heard I grew up as a very healthy
child without having any illnesses.

201
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,716
I have to go to a meeting.

202
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,049
I should go first.

203
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,050
Okay.

204
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:59,882
I will tell Dad you said hello.

205
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,640
Okay. Thank you.

206
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:06,940
What was that?

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,406
He told me
she's getting heart surgery.

208
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,273
Ji Sook, are you okay?

209
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,849
I told you that there is no need
to visit me.

210
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,282
I will soon go home.

211
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:26,106
How can I not visit?
I was worried about you.

212
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,740
How did you get hurt?

213
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:33,206
I just sprained my ankle.

214
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:35,640
Is that so?

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,006
I'm relieved that you were not
hurt badly.

216
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:43,373
I was so worried on the way,
just in case you were hurt severely.

217
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:52,149
Mom, I heard her memory returned.

218
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,673
I heard from Mr. Koo.

219
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:57,106
Don't worry.

220
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,806
Her memory hasn't returned entirely.

221
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,740
By the way, I heard she is
hospitalized.

222
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,740
By any chance, this isn't related
to you, is it?

223
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,706
No, I don't know anything about it.

224
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,182
How did you know about that?

225
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,749
I was planning to meet her
for canceling the store contract.

226
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,013
But I couldn't because I was told
she is in the hospital.

227
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:23,516
You didn't do anything to her,
right?

228
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,640
I told you I didn't!

229
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,906
Woo Seok, you remembered.

230
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,373
Whenever I was sick,
you bought this for me.

231
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,516
You told me this was
the most delicious food.

232
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,849
Do you not like this anymore?

233
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,182
How would I not like this?

234
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:47,673
You gave this to me.

235
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:51,540
Then have a bite.

236
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,806
Shall I?

237
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Do you like it?

238
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:08,606
I do.

239
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
It is sweet and delicious.

240
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:19,106
Is there anything else
you can remember?

241
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,806
I can vaguely...

242
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,506
remember that I was being chased
by someone, but nothing else.

243
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,306
Ms. Kang Ye Jin looked a lot
like you.

244
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,149
Her smile,

245
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,173
her kindness to others as well.

246
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,606
She was like watching
a younger version of you.

247
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,216
Of course, she is my daughter.

248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,806
Ye Jin resembles me,
which is why she is so pretty.

249
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
By the way,

250
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:00,140
is Ye Jin the only child you have?

251
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,606
Mom, I'm here.

252
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,373
What brings you here, Chairman Cha?

253
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,016
I should be going.

254
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,106
Wait.

255
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:26,973
Ms. Han.

256
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:33,473
Why did you have to call Yu Jung
who's innocent and be harsh to her?

257
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,973
Why do you have to make me
so miserable?

258
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,340
Chairman Cha, is there something
you want to tell me?

259
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:52,073
I apologize for speaking harshly
to you before.

260
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,406
I should have apologized earlier.
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It is okay. Don't be.

262
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,782
I understand what made you talk
to me that way.

263
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,906
I am sorry too.

264
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay, then. You may go now.

265
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,806
Mom, why did Chairman Cha come?

266
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:30,640
Ye Jin.

267
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,840
Some of my memory has returned.

268
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,706
Really? Which part?

269
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,573
Not all of it.
I could remember my name.

270
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,106
But still, I'm glad.

271
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,940
It's such good news.

272
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,449
Chairman Cha and I...

273
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,273
knew each other in the past.

274
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,373
When I was young,

275
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,440
I grew up in an orphanage.

276
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:04,540
DL Group sponsored my orphanage.

277
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,006
That is how I got to know him.

278
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,540
I see.

279
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,806
That is amazing.

280
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:18,206
Hello, Prosecutor Jang?
Did you find that person?

281
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,460
Which penitentiary is he in?

282
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:26,873
Are you nervous?

283
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,616
I am not nervous.
I am gnashing my teeth!

284
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,249
If I think of my wrongful layoff
from the police because of him,

285
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:35,993
I can't let go of my anger
even in my sleep!

286
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,849
By the way, how was he caught?

287
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:42,677
He was imprisoned in the Philippines
for illegal prostitution...

288
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,535
and was transferred recently.

289
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:45,982
I see.

290
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:49,440
I won't let him off easy today.

291
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,382
You!

292
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:59,016
You are so dead!

293
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,416
Why are you doing this to me?

294
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,216
Let go of me. Let go!

295
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,482
Do you know how miserable
I've been because of you?

296
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:08,849
Did you know you could live well
after framing an innocent person?

297
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,049
You shouldn't be doing this.

298
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,582
Sang Tae, let him go!

299
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,540
Let's talk! Let's use words. Okay?

300
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,606
Sit down.

301
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:24,816
Long time no see.
Such manners you have to say hello.

302
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
You!

303
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,282
Why did you do that to me
five years ago?

304
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,649
You told me those were toilet paper!

305
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,816
Nobody gives bribe money as it is!

306
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,682
You know how it works.

307
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,116
What did you say?

308
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,949
You must be daring to die today,
aren't you?

309
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:44,649
Why don't we both die in here?

310
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,716
Sang Tae, stop!

311
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,373
Calm down, please!

312
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,873
You ripped my clothes!

313
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:55,206
Mr. Park Jin Soo.

314
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:57,406
Let's not waste time.

315
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,612
What's the reason you gave Sang Tae
the bribe he didn't even ask for?

316
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:08,840
I don't understand a single word
of what you are talking about.

317
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:12,606
Mr. Park.

318
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:18,006
You were imprisoned in the
Philippines because of prostitution.

319
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,382
I did some more research...

320
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,849
and it seems like you luckily
got away with drug distribution...

321
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,673
by getting in touch
with Chinese drug dealers.

322
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,273
But what do you think...

323
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,073
will happen if the Chinese police
find out about this?

324
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,340
They wouldn't just sit there,
would they?

325
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,671
You're also aware of that,

326
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,873
so you bought people's silence
in the Philippines.

327
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,482
So what?

328
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:46,506
What do you want?

329
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:49,740
"What do you want"?

330
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,440
Tell us the truth.

331
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,773
What is the reason
you framed Sang Tae?

332
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,206
Darn it!

333
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,616
I was paid!

334
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,973
I got a phone call, so I did
what I was ordered to do!

335
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,007
That's really all!

336
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,241
We were right.

337
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,365
Park Jin Soo's call history has...

338
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:30,214
the same burner phone number.

339
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:36,539
It's clear that all this is related
to my mom's case.

340
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:41,121
And now that we have
Park Jin Soo's statement,

341
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,845
you'll be able to clear your name...

342
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,968
if you tell the Audit
and Inspection Division.

343
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,854
Min Hyuk,

344
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:50,455
thank you so much
for doing all this.

345
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,686
It's nothing.

346
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,236
You were dismissed unfairly.

347
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,927
It's natural for you to have
your name cleared and reinstated.

348
00:20:56,053 --> 00:21:00,420
Okay. Once I'm reinstated,
I'll do my best to help you.

349
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,712
Now that I'm cleared,

350
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:07,303
I'll also help clear your mother
of her false accusation of murder.

351
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:11,502
Let's get the real culprit.

352
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,806
Yes, Sang Tae.

353
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,328
Cha Mi Ri.

354
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,727
Why are you back here?

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,401
Nothing would change
from coming here.

356
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:39,315
Forget it.

357
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,373
I'll just leave.

358
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,450
But since I'm here,

359
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,672
should I get a quick look
at Sang Tae?

360
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:04,641
Mi Ri!

361
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:08,138
What are you doing here?

362
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:10,201
Sang Tae...

363
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,977
Mi Ri, are you drunk?

364
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,789
Yes.

365
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:26,716
I'm completely drunk on you.

366
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:31,422
That's why I can't sober up.

367
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,658
You can't even drink. Why did you...

368
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,662
drink so much?

369
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,810
Are you worrying about me?

370
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:44,501
Why did you tell me to break up
if you were going to be so worried?

371
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:51,211
I can't live without you.

372
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,878
Sang Tae, can't we just get
back together?

373
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,482
I told you we can't.

374
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,252
It might be hard for now,

375
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,366
but time will resolve it.

376
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,733
When?

377
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:07,658
How long do I have to wait
for it to be resolved?

378
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,238
Here.

379
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:22,241
Take this.

380
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,739
What is this?

381
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,352
Coffee?

382
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:35,180
It's your favorite coffee.

383
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,084
Take that...

384
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:40,626
and enjoy the drink.

385
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:45,561
You will feel much better...

386
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:51,106
when you're finished
with that coffee.

387
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:09,919
All the data deleted on the phone
has been recovered with forensics.

388
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:17,595
(Birth Certificate)

389
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,887
Yu Ra gave birth?

390
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,040
(Father: Lee Tae Poong,
Mother: Han Yu Ra)

391
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,210
Lee Tae Poong?

392
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:35,091
Seo Jun, I have to find Tae Poong.

393
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:37,515
Because of me, Tae Poong is...

394
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:40,218
Tae Poong!

395
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,489
Yu Jung looked for this man
five years ago in Chuncheon.

396
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,924
Does Yu Jung know
who Lee Tae Poong is?

397
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,881
What is it?

398
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:00,539
Do you know Lee Tae Poong?

399
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,985
What?

400
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,342
You looked for Lee Tae Poong
five years ago in Chuncheon.

401
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,412
Did you find him back then?

402
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,016
Why do you ask that suddenly?

403
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,484
Yu Ra married Lee Tae Poong
and even had a child.

404
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:15,596
Did you know about it?

405
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:17,024
What?

406
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:19,328
No.

407
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:22,592
I think I need to meet Mr. Lee.

408
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,963
Where is he now?

409
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,199
Seo Jun doesn't seem to know
that Tae Poong is Min Hyuk yet.

410
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:33,860
Yu Jung.

411
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:38,158
I don't know. I couldn't find him.

412
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,393
I see.

413
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:47,432
But how do you know Mr. Lee?

414
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:50,927
I just know him.

415
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:54,429
And I'm not sure if he's
the same person you're looking for.

416
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,674
He might just have the same name.

417
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:00,710
I see.

418
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,335
You can go now.

419
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,602
Okay.

420
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:17,115
Yu Ra, see me for a moment.

421
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:20,733
Seo Jun is looking
for Lee Tae Poong.

422
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:23,121
He even found out
that Yu Ra gave birth,

423
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:26,057
and asked me if I knew
where Lee Tae Poong was.

424
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:27,226
Is that so?

425
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,995
I did tell him I didn't know,

426
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,564
but what if he finds out
about your identity soon?

427
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:36,379
Don't worry.

428
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,004
Even if Seo Jun tries
to dig into me,

429
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,206
he won't be able to find me.

430
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:44,509
I deleted every trace of me
left in Chuncheon.

431
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:47,012
Even the wedding photo
in the photo studio.

432
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:48,581
I see.

433
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,583
But why do I feel so anxious?

434
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:54,152
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

435
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:57,721
But how do you think
Seo Jun found out?

436
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:01,293
I'm not sure.

437
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:05,041
Dae Chul,

438
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:07,832
you haven't changed at all.

439
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:09,568
Has it been 30 years
since we last met?

440
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:10,803
Yes.

441
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,166
So, Chun Soo. How have you been?

442
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:17,220
We were so close by
yet we didn't know.

443
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,486
I found out only recently
that Ms. Han is your daughter.

444
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:22,017
I'd have found you faster
if only I realized it sooner.

445
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,879
That's right.

446
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:31,067
By the way, Dae Chul, Ms. Han grew
up to be such a fine lady.

447
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:34,191
Is she all healthy now?
And is her heart okay?

448
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:36,639
What?

449
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:41,331
Back then, you struggled so much
because of her heart issues.

450
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,312
Yes, that's true.

451
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:48,173
Has her heart been fine
ever since then?

452
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:52,622
Yes, Seo Jun. I just got here.

453
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,946
I'll wait for you inside.
Come safely.

454
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,182
Her operation went very well.

455
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,118
She's all healthy now.

456
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:08,815
What is this?

457
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,807
Why is Dad meeting up with Mr. Koo?

458
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:20,238
I'm glad she's healthy.

459
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,575
By the way, Dae Chul,

460
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,778
that child...

461
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:32,017
Hey, Chun Soo. I have to go now.

462
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,031
I forgot about an urgent delivery
to make.

463
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:38,322
Okay, sure.

464
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,838
Hey, Chun Soo, I'm so sorry.

465
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,777
It's not a problem.
I'm so happy to see you.

466
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:48,702
Let's go for a drink someday.

467
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,302
- Sure.
- I'll get going.

468
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,171
- Go on.
- Bye.

469
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:12,926
What was that?

470
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,305
Why did you meet up with Mr. Koo?

471
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,862
It's none of your business.

472
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:20,164
None of my business? What did you
talk about? Tell me now.

473
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,101
Mind your own business.

474
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,272
Dad!

475
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:37,206
"Dad"?

476
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:40,330
I'm sorry, Yu Ra.

477
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,250
I don't think I can make it
due to an urgent meeting.

478
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:43,520
I'll see you at home.

479
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,724
I understand. Okay.

480
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,926
Bye.

481
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:53,807
That man is Yu Ra's father?

482
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:58,080
Her father isn't a dentist.

483
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,000
As far as I know, he worked...

484
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:03,486
as a chauffeur for the owner
of a food company in Chuncheon.

485
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,344
And her mother worked
as a maid for the owner.

486
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:12,518
I have a request to make.

487
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:15,520
Could you look
into a food company in Chuncheon?

488
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:18,503
Yes. The man who worked
as the chauffeur.

489
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:23,402
And please look into Lee Tae Poong
who lived in Chuncheon as well.

490
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:25,708
- Here.
- Thank you.

491
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:28,932
So you are my husband's
hometown friend?

492
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:30,503
Yes. I just met with Dae Chul now,

493
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,570
and he told me he had a store here.

494
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:36,106
I came to buy one for myself.

495
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:38,921
Is that so? How thoughtful.

496
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:41,846
Take your time looking
at this catalog, then.

497
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,948
Thank you.

498
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,890
Let's see.

499
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:49,296
There are a lot of models.

500
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:54,557
By the way, you are quite amazing.

501
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,228
I am?

502
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,974
What for?

503
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:01,629
Raising someone else's child isn't
as easy...

504
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,413
as it sounds.

505
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:05,870
It's not something anyone can do.

506
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:11,192
What are you talking about?

507
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:15,479
You don't have to hide it from me.

508
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:17,350
I know it all.

509
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:20,485
Dae Chul felt awfully sorry to you.

510
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,701
A daughter of yours had
cardiac surgery,

511
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:24,734
and you had to raise
a stranger's child.

512
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,292
He felt so guilty about it.

513
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:31,837
He even told you about that?

514
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,299
You two must be really close.

515
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:36,434
Of course.

516
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,070
You must have gone through a lot.

517
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:43,486
What could I have done?

518
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,016
I didn't give birth to the child,

519
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,814
but she is still my husband's child.

520
00:31:50,348 --> 00:31:52,515
I had to raise the child well.

521
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:05,463
It's so nice and warm.

522
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,705
It's so nice to have one gifted...

523
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:11,035
after only selling it.

524
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:16,812
What is this?

525
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,577
Why is this here?

526
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:24,147
You have
such a great hometown friend.

527
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,452
What?

528
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,253
Your friend bought this for us.

529
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:35,224
I don't have any hometown friends.

530
00:32:35,262 --> 00:32:37,729
What do you mean?
You seemed so close.

531
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:39,432
And a friend with no secrets.

532
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm talking about Mr. Koo Chun Soo,
your friend.

533
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,713
What?

534
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:49,608
Director Cha.

535
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:51,544
Are you working late on your own?

536
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,145
That's so hardworking of you.

537
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,480
I've signed it, so take a look
and go home.

538
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,183
Okay. Thank you.

539
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,352
Sure.

540
00:33:12,503 --> 00:33:14,204
Mind your own business.

541
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,432
Dad!

542
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,016
This man is...

543
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:33,772
It's Yu Jung's family.

544
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,099
I'm sorry?

545
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:43,163
Woman, get up here.

546
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:48,064
So you told Chun Soo about Yu Jung?

547
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,969
Why are you yelling at me?

548
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:53,905
You were the one who told him first.

549
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:55,570
What?

550
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,221
He already knew about everything.

551
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,478
That Yu Ra had cardiac surgery...

552
00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:03,847
and that Yu Jung was a child
you brought with you.

553
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:06,618
Mr. Koo knew everything
and told me about it.

554
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,120
What?

555
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:10,922
He knew about it?

556
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,993
What did you just say now?

557
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:21,711
I was brought from somewhere else?

558
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:24,469
What do you mean by that?

559
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,900
(A Man in a Veil)

560
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,701
You had an affair behind Mom's back?

561
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:57,269
Why did you give birth to me?

562
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,038
It'd have been better if you didn't!

563
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,573
Why did you lie to me?

564
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:01,508
What lie?

565
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,796
Is Ms. Han the child from then?

566
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:06,456
Would this help in finding
my lost past?

567
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
Haven't you thought of a way
to deal with Seo Ji Sook yet?

568
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:10,349
There's a way.

569
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:13,318
I don't care. I'll do anything
as long as the two don't meet.

570
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:16,087
Han Yu Jung and Han Yu Ra.
The two were sisters?

571
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,590
Yu Ra, let's get a divorce.

572
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:20,058
I found something
to hold you responsible for.

573
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:21,527
What do you think?

00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,970
(Episode 74)

2
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,584
You're asking for trouble,
aren't you?

3
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,160
Han Jae Soo!

4
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,908
Give me the will
when I'm asking you nicely.

5
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:55,015
I can't. I will never give it
to you.

6
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:59,646
Fine. You're already registered
as dead,

7
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:02,438
so you wouldn't have any regrets
if you die right now.

8
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,185
Yes, I don't have any regrets.

9
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,132
But I won't die in your hands.

10
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,624
Dae Ro!

11
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:16,004
You prick!

12
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:34,998
Dad.

13
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,301
You jerk.

14
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,826
What have you done to him?

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,222
Should I kill both you
and your dad together?

16
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,094
Dad.

17
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:16,646
You're messing with me
because of this will, aren't you?

18
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,429
Without this will,

19
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:22,981
how are you going to prove that
Han Jae Soo didn't kill Eok Shim?

20
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:26,566
You scumbag.

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,269
Tell me you'll hand over
Wonky Box Lunch.

22
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,767
Say it, you brat!

23
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,263
Dad.

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
Dad.

25
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:01,134
Dae Ro.

26
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:05,005
Dad, are you all right?

27
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:06,556
I'm all right.

28
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:07,973
Are you all right?

29
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,679
- Yes.
- What about the will?

30
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,234
It's right here.

31
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,155
Can you walk?

32
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,906
Yes, let's hurry.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,914
Let's go.

34
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,045
Okay, Dad.

35
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,626
- Are you really all right?
- Yes.

36
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,303
Goodness.

37
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,627
Where are we going to hide
that will?

38
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,630
I think we should hide it
in the office temporarily.

39
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,654
Okay.

40
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,226
Dae Ro.

41
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:50,299
Let's hide it here.

42
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,428
Let's put it there for now.

43
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:01,696
Oh, my.

44
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,297
What happened to your faces?

45
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:06,559
Did you hurt your hand too?

46
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:08,794
Is this Ma Chung Goo's doing?

47
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:10,276
Yes.

48
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:14,537
Why is he doing this to you
and Ms. Han?

49
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:19,196
He tried to steal Dad's sister's
will, so we struggled a bit.

50
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,271
What?

51
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,931
So what happened to the will?

52
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:24,757
Thankfully, we retrieved it.

53
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,047
But would he give up easily?

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,900
What if he comes here again?

55
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:34,561
I know. What are we going to do
if he makes a scene again?

56
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:38,707
Why don't we just sell the land
in Gurye and pay him back?

57
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,786
You'll be able to recover
your identity in 15 days.

58
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,101
So we just need to bear with it
until then.

59
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,696
You'll get punished if you sell
the land in her name.

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,482
Dear me.

61
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,809
Sir, are you all right now?

62
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,515
Yes. You guys got a fright, right?

63
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:59,907
Thank you for looking after
the company while I was gone.

64
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,565
But is it okay for you
to come back to work already?

65
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:07,327
I missed you guys so much
that I couldn't stay put.

66
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:08,755
Anyway,

67
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,209
did DBS confirm the cast list
and the host?

68
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,663
Don't get me started.

69
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,161
We proposed Hong Young Ja
as the host, but they refused.

70
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,643
What?

71
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,050
Then who do they want as the host?

72
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:24,171
I think they're trying to stop us
from producing the show.

73
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:25,406
What should we do?

74
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:27,823
Why those people!

75
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,835
They making my blood soar
as soon as I return to work.

76
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:35,331
Wouldn't it be difficult for them
to refuse Koo Hyun Moo as a host?

77
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:38,501
Right. He'd be great!

78
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,915
Let's get it confirmed!

79
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,597
But the problem is the guarantee.

80
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,766
Oh, Jun Soo promised
to invest in the company.

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,752
I'll ask him to fund the production
of "Marketaurant" as well,

82
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,109
so raise the guarantee right away.

83
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,331
Jun Soo will invest
in Na Production?

84
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,355
What?

85
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,424
Yes.

86
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,719
Welcome.

87
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,657
What are we here for?

88
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,943
Are you going to wear a hoodie
and sneakers to meet my parents?

89
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,938
I have heels and outfits.

90
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,257
Just buy them.

91
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,786
I want to buy them for you.

92
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:29,310
Don't you know that your lover
will run away if you buy them shoes?

93
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:34,857
Do you want me to wear these shoes
and be gone from your sight forever?

94
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,576
You're younger than me...

95
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,587
and a screenwriter,
but why are you so slow?

96
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:45,230
Don't you know people give you shoes
to walk the good path together?

97
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,251
Gosh, that's cheesy.

98
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,683
Hurry up and chose something
you like.

99
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,839
How about this ivory colored boots?

100
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,722
These stitches
make your legs look slimmer...

101
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,829
and the heels look unique too.

102
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,137
That looks good.

103
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,310
Try them on.

104
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,921
This way.

105
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,256
How do I look?

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,885
I kind of feel awkward.

107
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,187
They look pretty.

108
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,682
It suits you very well.

109
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:35,717
- Then we'll take this,
- Yes.

110
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,806
This loafer,

111
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,083
these sneakers,

112
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,585
and that loafer too.

113
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:44,227
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:48,021
Why would you buy so many shoes?

115
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:49,954
What am I? A centipede?

116
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:54,040
Wear them on proper occasions.

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,928
Stop wearing sneakers all the time.

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,624
I'll take this handbag too.

119
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:05,646
I can't even fit a laptop in there.
How am I going to use this tiny bag?

120
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:10,125
You could carry it at times
when you don't need a laptop.

121
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,432
Your boyfriend has such great taste.

122
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,681
You must be pleased.

123
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,571
Let's try this on.

124
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,317
Do you like sundae soup that much?

125
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,448
I didn't use to like it this much.

126
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,334
But I crave it these days.

127
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:24,428
Is that so?

128
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,753
Eat up.

129
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,124
Would you like to take some home?

130
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,398
This is enough.
I don't need to take it home.

131
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,681
Oh, right. Since you didn't want
to see the house with me,

132
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,436
I picked a house.

133
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,778
Here.

134
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,103
What do you think?
If you like it, I'll buy it.

135
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,588
How many square feet is this place?

136
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,069
It's about 158 or 165 square meters
or something.

137
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:56,951
Why do we need such a big house
when it's only the four of us?

138
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,128
You need a walk-in closet,
study room, and bedrooms.

139
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,261
Four people need about a house
of this size.

140
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,211
Even if I cancel
the pension insurance,

141
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:07,069
I can't fill up this huge house
with appliances.

142
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,266
Who asked you for that?

143
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,003
All I need is you.

144
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,270
Even though
it's a contractual marriage,

145
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,900
how can I go in empty-handed?

146
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,402
I'll just prepare what I can.

147
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:19,794
I said you don't need to.

148
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,372
I'll take care of everything.

149
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:22,640
Don't mind it, Ms. Shin.

150
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,933
Still, that's wrong.

151
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,469
Let's just start with two bedrooms.

152
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:31,325
Byeo Ri and I will take one,
and you can take the other.

153
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
What?

154
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,362
Are you leaving me out?

155
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,182
Fine, then. I'll compromise
and make it three bedrooms.

156
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:42,977
But...

157
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:47,734
if we tell them we'll be living with
Byeo Ri, your parents won't like it.

158
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,591
I'm worried about that.

159
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,070
You're not marrying my parents.

160
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:54,497
I told you it's okay.
What is there to worry about?

161
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,602
The stuff we bought is too heavy
for you to carry,

162
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,371
so I'll bring it over later
in the evening.

163
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,138
I'm not at home in the evening.

164
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,218
What? Why?

165
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:13,023
My grandfather wants
to have dinner with the family,

166
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,182
so I'm going there.

167
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,461
Is that so?

168
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,630
Byeo Ri will be alone.

169
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,497
Yes. I don't like that.

170
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,505
Then I can go over
and have dinner with Byeo Ri.

171
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,031
Have fun at your grandfather's.

172
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,812
Oh, I'm late.

173
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,772
Are you here to cook?

174
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:39,507
What?

175
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,453
What happened to your forehead?

176
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,655
You left early in the morning
without even making breakfast.

177
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,225
I slipped in the ice
and hit a telephone pole.

178
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,120
My whole body aches,
but I'm here to cook because of you.

179
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,708
Oh, my back.

180
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,275
Oh, here.

181
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,876
You surprised me!

182
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,002
Go away, old man!

183
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,103
Stay still, I'll put it on for you!

184
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,762
You shameless old man!

185
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,055
You're creeping me out! Go away!

186
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,135
What?

187
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,422
Are you being shy?

188
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,758
I don't like it...

189
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,894
when somebody touches me.
Go! I said go!

190
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:24,895
Dad.

191
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,697
What? Oh, Hae Shim, you're here.

192
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,722
I am.

193
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,459
Ms. Han, what's wrong?

194
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,881
Oh, she fell on the ice,

195
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:40,068
so I said I'd help put the patches
on, and she's making a big scene!

196
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:42,904
Oh, is that what that was?

197
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:45,516
Are you injured? Let me help
put the patches on.

198
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,151
No need for that.

199
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,219
I don't like it...

200
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,755
when people touch me.
I really don't like it.

201
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,382
I don't even like my own hands
touching my own body!

202
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:59,130
She's just weird. Leave her be!

203
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,889
Why are you here so early?

204
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:06,079
Our family is having dinner,
so of course, I should cook.

205
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,065
I see.

206
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:08,177
Oh, my goodness.

207
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:12,543
Isn't this Korean beef?

208
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,713
What? This is so expensive!

209
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,114
It was a gift.

210
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,116
I brought it,
so we could share it with you.

211
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,944
Who gave you such an expensive gift?

212
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,160
Just someone we know.

213
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:27,491
Ms. Han,

214
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,661
you must be in pain. Go rest.

215
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,564
No, I'm fine.

216
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:32,937
I've soaked the mung beans,

217
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:35,258
so I can make some pancakes,
japchae, salads...

218
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,000
That's too much trouble.

219
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,769
We can just grill the beef.

220
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,562
It's fine. Oh, my, it might get
cooked if you put it on top of that.

221
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,588
Your Wonky Box Lunch is here!

222
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,801
- It's Kim Bo Ra!
- Wow!

223
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,939
Can I have a picture?

224
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,254
Welcome, Ms. Kim!

225
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,782
What happened to your face?

226
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:02,880
Your hands are hurt too!

227
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,562
I got hurt while working.

228
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:08,690
You should be more careful.
What happened?

229
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,625
It's fine.

230
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:15,163
Oh, right. The comments on
"Here Comes Bo Ra" are really great.

231
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,099
The Weather Fairy Kim Bo Ra
is still quite popular.

232
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,911
I thought about it.

233
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:24,238
What do you think about continuing
"Here Comes Bo Ra" for a while?

234
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,843
Why don't you make your own channel
names "Here Comes Bo Ra"?

235
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,154
My own channel?

236
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:32,123
That's right.
We can call it a collaboration...

237
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:34,158
between Wonky Box Lunches
and Kim Bo Ra.

238
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,861
You can make your own channel
and communicate with your fans.

239
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,131
We can have you deliver
Wonky Box Lunches...

240
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,390
and promote our product.

241
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,351
It's a win-win for both of us.

242
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,127
That sounds good.

243
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,364
It's good to have a constant flow
of uploads in the beginning.

244
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:55,136
Then why don't we film
about twice a week?

245
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,172
Okay. Let's work together then.

246
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,120
Mr. Ma.

247
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,621
How did it go down with the will?

248
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,132
Don't even bring it up.

249
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,959
I have a cast on my arm
because of those jerks.

250
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,083
What?

251
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:15,030
That's why I said
I need hazard pay upfront.

252
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,634
If you don't pay me,
I'm taking my hand off the case.

253
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:18,936
What are you saying, Mr. Ma?

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,964
Come on.

255
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:22,868
My arm is messed up. What can I do?

256
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,126
I don't even have my guys.

257
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,235
There's no time. It's just one day
until tomorrow.

258
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:31,630
If you use more people,
will you make sure you handle it?

259
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:34,591
You can solve everything with money.

260
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,511
You're sure about this?

261
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:40,915
I'll start moving
as soon as you send me the money.

262
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,635
Chairperson, you called for me?

263
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,794
I did. Sit down.

264
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:59,009
Director Kim...

265
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:02,270
was confident that he would get
Wonky Box Lunch in the market.

266
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,596
Is this trustworthy news?

267
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
What?

268
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,677
I've never heard about it.

269
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,415
There's no reason for Kang Dae Ro
to hand over his company.

270
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,065
Then why...

271
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,687
did Director Kim say
such a ridiculous thing?

272
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,125
You said you were acquainted
with Kang Dae Ro, right?

273
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:27,681
Look into what happened discreetly.

274
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,515
Yes, I will.

275
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,735
Host Koo Hyun Moo said he'd do it
if the pay fits.

276
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,121
That's good.

277
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:41,019
DBS won't be able to nag at us
if he comes on board.

278
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,211
But CEO Na,

279
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,026
it looks like you made up
with Jun Soo all of a sudden.

280
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:48,249
He said he's giving us
financial support.

281
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:51,921
I almost died and came back,

282
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,110
so he feels bad.
That's why he's doing it.

283
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:57,258
It didn't look that simple.

284
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,195
Did you give Jun Soo and Ms. Shin
permission to get married...

285
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,573
in exchange for financial support?

286
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,889
Producer Um, you know the deal.

287
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:09,250
The more you try to separate them,
the more their longing will grow.

288
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,781
I gave permission for now,

289
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:13,608
and my wife said she'd separate them
using any means!

290
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,685
CEO Na!

291
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,900
How could you say allow it
so easily?

292
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,314
I shouldn't have stayed here.

293
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,586
I turned down DBS's scout offer
to stay.

294
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:28,189
I think...

295
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,287
I'm going to have to pack up.

296
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:33,591
My gosh!
Producer Um, don't be like that.

297
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:36,185
Who's going to work on
"Marketaurant"?

298
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,408
I planned it,

299
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,534
so I'll take it to DBS
and work on it.

300
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:43,947
I told you, I'm on your side.

301
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:47,742
We need to stick together,
even if it's just the two of us!

302
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,089
As long as you stay here,

303
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,992
I'll do my best
to get Jun Soo divorced...

304
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:57,351
and back with you.

305
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,564
Producer Um, you saved my life.

306
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:04,134
If it weren't for you,
I would have been dead already.

307
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:08,329
I'll make sure to keep my promise
to you somehow.

308
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:12,212
You're sure you can keep your word?

309
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,266
Of course.

310
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,050
Jun Soo.

311
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:21,509
Byeo Ri.

312
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,056
What's all this?

313
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,816
The shopping bags belong to Ah Ri,

314
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,745
and this is a cheese pork cutlet
for you.

315
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:35,042
This place is really popular.
I stood in line to get this.

316
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:35,989
Let's eat.

317
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,192
Wow, it looks delicious.

318
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,429
What did you get for Ah Ri?

319
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,474
Ah Ri and my parents
are meeting tomorrow...

320
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,877
to set the wedding date.

321
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:49,012
Those are the clothes and shoes
she's wearing to the meeting.

322
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,072
Byeo Ri, it's me!

323
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,475
It's Ms. Han!

324
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,481
- Grandma!
- Byeo Ri!

325
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,065
Hello.

326
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,020
I brought some food for Byeo Ri.
I thought she was alone.

327
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,689
Grandma, this is my brother-in-law.
You've never met, right?

328
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,936
The guy that looks like a goat?

329
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,261
I've seen him on television.

330
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,961
I've seen you on the show too.

331
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:20,401
Right. You were eating. Let's eat.

332
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,447
You should have dinner with us.

333
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:27,250
That's okay. I worked in front
of food all day, so I'm not hungry.

334
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:31,287
I'll put this in the fridge,
so you and Ah Ri can have it.

335
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:32,686
Don't give him any.

336
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:38,452
It seems like Mr. Kang and you
visit Ms. Shin's place often.

337
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,255
Why? Is something wrong with that?

338
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,126
No. I just heard from Ms. Shin
that you had a special connection.

339
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,595
How do you know her?

340
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,864
Don't go poking your nose
in everything.

341
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,708
Let's keep some distance.

342
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,244
I'm going to marry Ms. Shin.

343
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:56,268
I think this is something I can ask.

344
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,409
The truth is, Uncle Dae Ro
used to know my mom.

345
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:03,044
Really?

346
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,345
What about her?

347
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,549
Ms. Han is my friend.

348
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:10,904
Friend?

349
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:14,188
Don't you know what that is?
A friend?

350
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,348
It looks delicious.

351
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,649
When did you prepare all this food?

352
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:23,407
Ms. Han had it all prepared.

353
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:25,922
You must've been startled yesterday,
Father.

354
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,791
I'll make sure
to install a window guard.

355
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:32,767
You don't have to.
There is nothing to steal here.

356
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,297
Also, I have two young men
living here.

357
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,189
You don't need to worry.

358
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:41,268
I guess it's Ah Ri. Let me get that.

359
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:51,145
Hello, Grandpa. I'm Shin Ah Ri.

360
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,641
It's you. You came
for the shoot last time. Goodness.

361
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:59,155
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself
that day.

362
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,080
I got some green tea.

363
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,923
You didn't have to.

364
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,819
Why don't you sit? Goodness.

365
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:13,145
We should've gathered for a meal
earlier.

366
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,359
I hope this is not too late.

367
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,817
I'm so glad that we could
all be here for a meal today.

368
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:23,841
Now then.

369
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:26,907
- You must be famished. Let's eat.
- Sure.

370
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:35,721
How old are you, Ah Ri?

371
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:37,656
I'm 29.

372
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,224
Really?
You're the same age as Bo Ra.

373
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,522
Ah Ri's birthday
comes three months before Bo Ra.

374
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,126
Are you dating anyone, Ah Ri?

375
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:54,941
Yes.

376
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:12,095
Are you not getting back? It's late.

377
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,404
I'll go after Byeo Ri goes to bed,
so you may go.

378
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:17,830
It's all right.
I'll go when Ms. Shin gets here.

379
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:22,171
I will take care of Byeo Ri.
You could get back now.

380
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:25,052
Goodness. You talk like you've
always been taking care of her.

381
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:28,433
We're going to live together.
I should get to know her.

382
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,280
Oh, my goodness.

383
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:32,604
Let's ask Byeo Ri then.

384
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:35,446
Byeo Ri.
Who do you want to stay with?

385
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:40,324
I like you...

386
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,596
as well as Jun Soo.

387
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:44,527
What's that?

388
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:47,762
But if you had to choose one,
who would it be?

389
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:50,720
Is it me or that goat?

390
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,416
Sorry?

391
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:56,306
It's hard for me to say.

392
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,776
If you want to stay longer,
please do.

393
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,689
You're putting her on the spot.

394
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,447
It's funny you should say that.

395
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,950
When did I put her on the spot?

396
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,515
Byeo Ri. You can say it.

397
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:13,612
It's okay if you say
you like me more.

398
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:18,033
But I really like you both.

399
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,856
Don't you like me a bit more?

400
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,117
You're back so early.

401
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:40,450
What about Byeo Ri?

402
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:43,753
Na Jun Soo was there
to give her dinner.

403
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:47,046
I know what he's like.
He came over to care for Byeo Ri?

404
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:50,193
He was acting proudly saying
that he's her brother-in-law.

405
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:52,075
My goodness. What an eyesore.

406
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:55,754
"What is your relationship
with Byeo Ri for you to come here?"

407
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:59,333
He was being so inquisitive
that I was dumbfounded.

408
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:04,007
Won't we have to live with Byeo Ri
when Ms. Shin gets married?

409
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:05,445
Of course.

410
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:09,079
Even if it would hurt Ms. Shin,
we should take her in.

411
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:13,089
Even if she insists on keeping
Byeo Ri, I won't let that happen.

412
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,607
I can't let her live in the house
of my enemy's son.

413
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:22,547
What do we do if Ms. Shin
refuses to let her go?

414
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:25,711
Then I'll have
to tell her the truth...

415
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:28,039
that I am Byeo Ri's dad.

416
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:37,140
Drinking this green tea
after eating beef...

417
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:40,514
gets rid of the greasiness.
It's so refreshing.

418
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:43,229
I'm glad you like it.

419
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,185
Grandpa is a picky eater.

420
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:47,222
The green tea you brought
is delicious.

421
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:49,182
You did.

422
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:54,263
By the way,
Ah Ri is dating someone, right?

423
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:57,022
Come to think of it,
she's at that age.

424
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:59,402
Do you have plans to get married?

425
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:05,301
Since you mention it,
the parents on both sides...

426
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:07,668
are meeting tomorrow
ahead of her marriage.

427
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:09,305
Is that so?

428
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,102
That's great news.

429
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,032
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.

430
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:16,780
What? Okay.

431
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:18,671
Well, then.

432
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:22,977
What does Ah Ri's boyfriend
do for a living?

433
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,222
Why won't you tell me?

434
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:29,488
Should it be kept confidential?

435
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,629
It's nothing like that.

436
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:37,992
It's CEO Na Jun Soo of Daybreak.

437
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,660
Na Jun Soo?

438
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:44,915
Are you saying...

439
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:49,807
Ah Ri is the reason
that Bo Ra got dumped?

440
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:53,852
Dad, it's not like that.

441
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,218
What do you mean it's not?

442
00:25:56,812 --> 00:26:00,346
Bo Ra made a mistake on air
because of that jerk.

443
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:03,593
That's why she went off the grid
and ran away from home.

444
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:06,550
How hurt must've she been
to do such a thing?

445
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:09,090
That's a misunderstanding.

446
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:11,483
I heard it from Bo Ra herself.

447
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:14,904
She told me that Na Jun Soo
would make a good husband.

448
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:17,506
So I even told her
to invite him home.

449
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,768
But you're going
to let him marry Ah Ri?

450
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:25,585
How could you be so harsh
to Bo Ra as her parents?

451
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:26,774
I...

452
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,751
That's not what it is.

453
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:32,953
Joong Han.
I thought you love Bo Ra dearly.

454
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:34,381
How could you let this happen?

455
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,005
Is this because Ah Ri
is your daughter...

456
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,479
and Bo Ra is not your own?

457
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:42,065
Dad. That's not true.

458
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,122
Please calm down.

459
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,453
Shut it.

460
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,125
You're her mother.

461
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,771
How could you let the man
that Bo Ra loves marry Ah Ri?

462
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:53,923
Are you in your right mind?

463
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:56,987
Relax, Grandpa.

464
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:00,049
My love for Jun Soo was one-sided.

465
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:02,423
He likes Ah Ri, not me.

466
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,922
You don't need to lie to me.

467
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:08,580
I don't approve of this marriage!

468
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:10,965
That jerk hurt Bo Ra.

469
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:13,022
How could I let him be
part of our family?

470
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,154
I can't let that happen.

471
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:16,761
Dad.

472
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:19,196
Ah Ri...

473
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,297
is pregnant with Jun Soo's baby.

474
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,836
What did you say?

475
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,364
(No Matter What)

476
00:27:58,431 --> 00:27:59,383
Tell me!

477
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:00,753
You knew about this, Dae Ro.
Didn't you?

478
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:02,121
Don't be anxious.

479
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:03,279
I will protect you.

480
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:04,547
Are you saying that you'll move out?

481
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:06,216
Are you trying to give her
a hard time living with the in-laws?

482
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,063
I heard you're meeting
your future in-laws today.

483
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,654
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
